Anne bounded in the door, effusing hugs and giggles with her signature enthusiasm. We hadn&#8217;t seen each other in person for several years, but as friends and sisters in Christ, we shared a history that spanned a few milestone-filled decades.</p>\n<p>Anne handed me a small gift bag made of colorful fabric and ribbon-tied with flair. At her request, I emptied the contents onto the kitchen counter. Most of the items were practical, yet thoughtful goodies, including a devotional and carefully printed Scripture verse. My eyes fell to a curious piece of knitting, a small rectangle of dark green yarn. Explaining how she was just learning to knit, Anne proudly held up her first project, a dishcloth, she announced. As she dangled the stitching between us, two irregular and sizable holes became evident&#8211;not a lacy design for effect. As a knitter, I recognized these holes as mistakes, places where stitches had been missed or dropped from her needles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how those holes got in there!&#8221; she announced with apparent surprise. I joined Anne&#8217;s infectious laughter and thanked her for her thoughtfulness in sharing her first efforts. We went proceeded to the dining room with our husbands for food and fellowship.</p>\n<p>All too soon, it was time to part. After final goodbyes and our friends drove away, I reached for the small swatch of knitting once again. I felt a tenderness of emotion as I stood holding this small patch of yarn. I wondered why. It was only a dishcloth. A flurry of insight washed over me as quickly as I had questioned my feelings. Then I understood. This simple gift represented so much more than my eyes could see.</p>\n<p>Anne had entrusted me with her handiwork&#8211;despite its flaws. Would<em><strong> I</strong> </em>have taken that risk, or would my pride have overruled? The Bible tells us, <em>&#8220;Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, <strong>humility,</strong> gentleness, and patience, Colossians 3:12,&#8221;</em> (NLT). I had witnessed my friend&#8217;s spiritual fruit in action.</p>\n<p>Tears bubbled up as I reflected on how Anne had trusted me &#8230; trusted me with her flaws, her imperfection. She didn&#8217;t ask for my approval of her knitting accomplishments. No, this small green square of knitted stitches was a reminder of our long-held friendship, a journey not without its own trials and breaches of understanding. Just as Laban declared in <em>Genesis 31:48: &#8220;This pile of stones will stand as a witness of the covenant we have made today,&#8221; </em>(NLT). I knew the dishcloth stood as a witness of our covenant relationship. Though it was not perfect, as neither of us were, we were bound together in Christ&#8217;s love and forgiveness.</p>\n<p>The Lord continued to layer His truths onto my heart. What joy that we can come before the Heavenly Throne as imperfect products, flawed by sin, while our Heavenly Father sees us through the filter of Christ&#8217;s sacrifice on the cross. <em>&#8220;Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes,&#8221;</em> <em>Ephesians 1:4</em> (NLT). When we ask for forgiveness, despite our &#8220;holes,&#8221; our sins, Father God cherishes us as His children. Indescribable grace and mercy! <em>&#8220;He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins,&#8221; Ephesians 1:7</em> (NLT).</p>\n<p>It became clear that this little dishcloth was much more than it would appear. It represented the way God has shown us to live in relationship with one another in the Body of Christ&#8211;the humility, trust, and love. It also shouted <em>grace, mercy, </em>and <em>forgiveness, </em>highlighting the loving Covenant with Father God. I knew then that this washcloth would <em>not </em>be used for washing dishes, but for teaching me how to live. Who would have imagined so much truth could be woven into a simple hand knitted washcloth?</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes,&#8221; Ephesians 1:4 (NLT).</em></p>\n<p>Joan C.

She would spin me around to the admiring audience, and say something like, “Look at all those blonde curls … just like her daddy’s.” Of course, my daddy was her little boy all grown up, and Grandma was pleased as punch that I had his blue eyes and platinum blonde hair.</p>\n<p>I have pondered why this experience always made me feel good. Of course, I admired my father. In fact, I loved him dearly. I looked like my father some would say, and that signified that I <em>was</em> his girl. I later grew to understand that these encounters provided a sense of belonging, <em>an identity</em>. With an unusual family name, we seemed some way peculiar, or set apart, but that also contributed to a distinguishing <em>identity.</em></p>\n<p>So who was this little girl with the blonde curls and unusual surname? As I matured, I had many questions about who “she” was, and whether her life bore any significance. I had confidence in my parents’ love, and as an added blessing, they instilled in me a hopeful, yet naïve belief, that I was capable of doing anything I put my mind to. That was all positive nurturing stuff. But, I needed more than that. Life doesn’t pour out continual blessings, and in times of discouragement and loss, I needed more to help me navigate through the tumult. Knowledge that I belonged to my family was not enough.</p>\n<p>My mom faithfully taught me from Scripture about our loving Creator God. So why did He create humans anyway? Was He lonely, or did He have unfulfilled needs? It always seemed logical to believe God didn’t require anyone to satisfy His existence. After all, how could an infinite omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent God need anything? When he completed making the world in all of its splendor, “… God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it was very good!” Genesis 1:31 (NLT). He didn’t need people to keep him content. No, to the contrary. God is creative by nature and love in substance.  “…let us continue to love one another, for love comes from God … But anyone who does not love does not know God, <strong>for God is love,</strong>” 1 John 4: 7-8 (NLT).  So, he created us by His love so that we could also love.</p>\n<p>I was astonished to learn that God chose to create human life IN HIS IMAGE. Realizing I have significance because the Creator of the Universe made me <em>in His image</em> is a grounding discovery, an “aha moment” of truth. I can have an eternal purpose in a relationship with this loving God. He even made sure my relationship would never be cut off by my own rebellion, “sin,” incompatible with His perfection. Revealing Himself to us through His Son Jesus – Immanuel, “God with us,” God invites us to accept His forgiveness when we have wandered off to have our own way. We are offered the gift of this priceless relationship when we come, ready to step into an identity with our Abba Father. We will be a “peculiar people,” set apart from the culture in a distinguishing way. We should then bear God’s image of love, and shine His light into the darkness.</p>\n<p>Imagine the importance each human life holds! “Love,” Himself, made you in His image! Human life is set apart – God did not breathe His spirit into the rest of creation. Go celebrate your sacred identity and live confidently as a child of God, the One true God. This is significance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-81\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2018/04/16/do-i-have-significance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-81\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2018/04/16/do-i-have-significance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-81\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2018/04/16/do-i-have-significance/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2018-04-16T14:09:05.000Z","excerpt":"<p>I still remember how proudly my grandma would show me off to her friends whenever we’d come for a visit.

The night my mother slipped into eternity, I slid her wedding band onto my finger, feeling the weight of its significance. Yet, I would learn even more from this ring in the years to come.</p>\n<p>My father had a beautiful platinum wedding band made for Mom after many years of marriage. Having wed during The Great Depression with no money for extras, this diamond studded ring was Dad’s thanks for her being there through the good seasons and the bad.</p>\n<p>Dad had been a frequent top salesman for his company, and for that distinction, he had been awarded “pins.” Almost annually, he was presented with a new recognition pin, often adorned with one tiny diamond to symbolize his success. Dad simply tucked them away in a drawer year after year. When the time was right, Dad suggested they have a jeweler make a new wedding band, using his tiny diamonds to cluster around a slightly larger stone. She chose her setting, and the ring was soon made to their specifications.</p>\n<p>After my mom passed away, my husband queried, “Do you want to have it resized so you can wear it?”</p>\n<p>“It’s so much more like my mom than me,” I countered, dismissing his idea. Mom was an attractive brunette who dressed with flair, and enjoyed splashy costume jewelry, perfectly accessorizing her outfits. Those pieces always looked wonderful on her. Me? I tended to be more of a minimalist who donned the same yellow gold necklace almost daily.</p>\n<p>“Well, we could have the ring reset if you’d like,” my husband encouraged.</p>\n<p>I felt guilty even contemplating the thought. It was as if it were a sacred extension of my mother. So, it sat, undisturbed in my jewelry box for three years.</p>\n<p>Then one day as I studied the Scriptures, I came across Psalm 139:13-14 once again. “You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! Your workmanship is marvelous–how well I know it,” Psalm 139:13-14 (NLT).</p>\n<p>A sense of freedom welled up in me as I contemplated her ring with new insight. Just as mother and I were distinctly different, this precious ring symbolized not only my parents’ legacy, but our distinct uniqueness. “Yet you, LORD, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand,” Isaiah 64:8 (NLT). The Lord saw me before I was born, and He knew each of us as He formed us.</p>\n<p>I thought of my mother and how dissimilar we had been. She used to laugh saying, “Where did you come from?” because we were nearly antithetical at times. We were mother and daughter, biologically linked, yet as different as we could be. Bound by mutual respect and love, shared family history, and a love for God, we loved each other–despite our contrasting traits.</p>\n<p>Instead of guilt that I would destroy something of my mother’s, I saw how symbolic it would be if I <em>did</em> change the setting. Father God is not surprised that we are distinctively different beings, and Mother’s ring is a constant and beautiful reminder of how uniquely He created each of us. Today I wear “our ring,” though now the small diamonds are set in a simpler band of yellow gold. Now it represents all three of us. I believe my parents would both approve.  Their legacy of life and faith has shaped who I am, built the foundation of my life, and I will be forever grateful for this inheritance. But, I am not my mother, or my father.

I also helped develop children&#8217;s Bible teaching literature for twelve years as a writer for LifeWay Christian Resources. I have written for various Christian magazines, such as The Christian Leader (Regent University Alumni magazine), SpiritLed Woman (Strang Publishing), ParentLife (LifeWay), and High Adventure for teens (Gospel Publishing House). More recently, I completed a young adult historical fiction novel, which is currently in the capable hands of my Christian publishing agent with Word Wise Media, David Fessenden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another book for young adults and teens is in the planning stages. Over the past few years, I have had the challenging, yet rewarding, experience of working as volunteer patient advocate for a pregnancy center. I feel called to share the heart stories of young women raised in a culture where sexual freedom, outside of the parameters of marriage, is the norm. By removing the topic of abortion from the intellectual debate between pro-life and pro-choice advocates, I invite readers to step into the hearts of those who experience life-altering decisions about their unplanned pregnancies. These scene snippets are based upon true events, but fictionalized. Some situations are prevalent themes while some are more rare and unique. My purpose is to help readers grasp the truth of countless untold stories and to counter the cultural claim of abortion being inconsequential. Most women do not readily share their abortion decisions, or their emotions before or after. Many hope no one ever finds out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Politicians, the courts, news media, and Hollywood have all proclaimed a woman&#8217;s &#8220;right&#8221; to abortion as a resolution for an unplanned pregnancy, sometimes going so far as to suggest we should &#8220;celebrate&#8221; it. Why not, they ask? After all, we are told, this genetic package of life is not life at all, but merely cells that are a part of the mother&#8217;s body.  I invite my readers to learn from those who are most deeply impacted as they wrestle with the physical, emotional, and spiritual impact of abortion in our culture.  I understand that some readers will disagree with my viewpoint, but this is a reality that is often ignored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the folder on this Blog named &#8220;Science and News about Life,&#8221; I will also post informational facts about the preborn which will rely on science discoveries over recent years. The toll young women carry in their hearts from this aberration from God&#8217;s plans is incalculable, without accounting for the millions of human lives that have been destroyed. May these stories shine God&#8217;s love and forgiveness to heal those who have been caught in this deception, and help others to thoughtfully consider the path that God intends for His children, &#8220;plans to give them a future and hope&#8221; (Jeremiah 19:11).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-182\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/13/stories-behind-the-debate-life-choices/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-182\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/13/stories-behind-the-debate-life-choices/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-182\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/13/stories-behind-the-debate-life-choices/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-01-13T22:46:33.000Z","excerpt":"<p>The Untold Truths As a freelance writer and retired educator, I have written extensively across the spectrum: fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and curriculum for multiple public educational publishing markets.

Yet, amazingly, it contains all the genetic coding that determines every detail of the newly created LIFE: hair and eye color, the unique lines of fingerprints, physical appearance, gender, the mature height, and even skin tone. Wow.</p>\n<p><strong>Psalm 139:13</strong> <em>“For You created my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; You works are wonderful, I know that full well.”</em></p>\n<p>The young nineteen-year-old sat quietly listening as the nurse explained that her pregnancy test in the clinic was positive … just as it had been at home. Makayla had taken three different tests that week. Each time, holding her breath, she watched as the test silently screamed. “Positive.” “Positive.” <em>“Positive!”</em></p>\n<p>Tears rolled down her sun bronzed cheeks as the news confirmed her fears. Why had she been swept away with summer love, she wondered? She had plans. She wanted to finish school. She dreamed of becoming a nurse someday. Having a baby was <em>not</em> in the picture. Would Kevin even still be a part of her life? They loved each other, but would they stay together? What would her parents say? She knew they would be very disappointed. But, disappointment was the least of their response, she was sure.</p>\n<p>“What are your plans for your pregnancy, Makayla?”</p>\n<p>Startled back from her own internal musings, Makayla looked down. “I need to have an abortion. I can’t have a child. I can’t be a single parent.”</p>\n<p>“Let’s talk for a few minutes, Makayla. You don’t have to make a decision now. You don’t have to decide anything even this week. But, you do need to have the facts about such a life-changing decision.”</p>\n<p>“I must have an abortion.”</p>\n<p>“We can give you education about what that means, Makayla, but take time to breathe and think about your options today. You know there are options, right?”</p>\n<p>“No, I don’t have any options. I cannot have this … this …. I cannot be a parent now …”</p>\n<p>As the counselor waited quietly, Makayla did breathe. And her tears ran down her face as she struggled to find a way to say what was on her heart.</p>\n<p>“I love children. I just can’t have a baby now,” she said, hesitantly. “Later, I can have children.”</p>\n<p>The counselor said that she understood how overwhelming everything must feel. “As you think about your future, and your future plans, it will help you to have some facts so you can make an informed decision, Makayla.”</p>\n<p>She nodded in agreement.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Lord, </em></p>\n<p><em>Please help Makayla. In her state of fear and anxiety, she needs to find You. She needs to know You, and to see Your provision as she walks in accord with Your will and purposes. Help her understand the truth about the Innocent One growing in her womb, and how precious it is in Your sight.</em></p>\n<p><em> In Jesus’s Name, amen.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-261\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/14/makaylas-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-261\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/14/makaylas-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-261\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/14/makaylas-story/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-01-14T00:36:27.000Z","excerpt":"<p>Makayla’s Story Makayla, did you know?

The heart can be seen on an ultrasound beating from 100-120 times a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeremiah 1:5&nbsp;</strong><em>&#8220;Before&nbsp;I&nbsp;formed&nbsp;you&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;womb,&nbsp;I knew&nbsp;you.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pastor of Jamie&#8217;s church began his sermon that Sunday in January by reading a familiar Scripture, Jeremiah 1:5: &#8220;Before I formed you, I knew you &#8230;&#8221; (NIV)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pastor James spoke with a forceful intonation as he began. &#8220;Most of us <em>also</em> know Jeremiah 29:11: &#8216;For I know the plans I have for you,&#8217; declares the Lord, &#8216;plans to give you hope and a future.&#8217; Such a comforting promise,&#8221; he added, becoming softer, more reflective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, pausing, the pastor looked around his congregation. &#8220;But, I have a question for us to consider this morning. If God forms life within the womb, and He has good plans for each and every one, what happens when, by choice, we terminate unborn lives?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pastor&#8217;s question hung in the air, seemingly forever. Not a sound could be heard in the large auditorium as the people silently processed the pastor&#8217;s question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie felt her own heart pounding hard in her chest. She wondered if her mom and dad could hear it like she could. She scrunched down a little lower in the pew, wishing she were invisible. Looking down at her Bible, she could at least escape eye contact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie had been in church her whole life, 17 years. The local church was a place where she had always attended Sunday School, worship services, and now as a teen, the youth group. This was where her friends were. She was sitting in her usual place, but she was hiding an enormous secret. An awful, most terrifying secret. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie was pregnant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had anyone noticed how miserable she was? Had she smiled enough in the past week to keep everyone in the dark? Nobody can know about this, Jamie thought. NO ONE. Life would never be the same again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie wrestled with her own thoughts during the rest of the sermon, gladly ready to flee when the final song was sung. After service, Dad asked if she and her mother wanted to go somewhere to have lunch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quickly she offered a negative before Mom had a chance to say anything. &#8220;No thanks, Dad. I have a ton of homework to take care of today. I&#8217;ll skip,&#8221; Jamie said, trying to sound as casual as possible with her unlikely response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later that afternoon, the phone rang. &#8220;Jamie! It&#8217;s Leah &#8212; for you,&#8221; her mother called.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking up the phone quickly, Jamie said, &#8220;Leah, I&#8217;ll have to call you later, or see you at school tomorrow, OK? Sorry I can&#8217;t talk now &#8230; too much homework to catch up on. Hope you understand.&#8221; She hung up quickly and walked back to her room to be alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie couldn&#8217;t face Leah. Not now. They had taken the vow to remain pure at the same youth camp. Jamie wanted to wait until she married the man of her dreams, the one she would have her family with. She and Leah were best friends, but she couldn&#8217;t tell her what happened. Leah would never look at her in the same way. Leah would never respect her again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie knew that even if she could hide her secret for a little while, she needed an action plan. She had always opposed abortion and she adored children. But, now &#8230; she was facing a terrifying reality. Would her parents forgive her, she wondered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie thought, &#8220;I know God is forgiving, but &#8230; what if I decide to get an abortion?  But, I can&#8217;t go through with this pregnancy. I just can&#8217;t,&#8221; Jamie muttered. &#8220;I have to check into abortion. But what about what pastor said? Does God have special plans for this little one?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie threw herself onto her bed, burying her face in her pillow to muffle her cries as she wept. There was so much to think about &#8230; but she couldn&#8217;t pray. Not then. She felt a million light years away from God.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Oh, God, Creator of all life on Earth. We humans often make choices which are contrary to Your good plans. You understand our weaknessess and You know how our free will often separates us from you. Help Jamie understand what she is about to do and look for a better solution. In Jesus&#8217;s name.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-285\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/16/jamies-choice/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-285\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/16/jamies-choice/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-285\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/16/jamies-choice/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-01-16T01:49:55.000Z","excerpt":"<p>Jamie, did you know? Just 4 weeks after fertilization, or 6 weeks since the first day of the mother&#8217;s last period (LMP), the &#8220;little one&#8221; is still tiny (about 1/8&#8243;), but the central nervous system structure has formed &#8230; the brain and spinal cord.

It was so tantalizing that I couldn&#8217;t wait to pull on boots and warm gear just to experience the&nbsp;magic outside my window. White puffs of delicate intricacy&nbsp;fell on my head, shoulders, and ultimately, my feet, creating virgin footprints in the yet untouched snow. Everything in sight was transformed to a pristine state of perfection. Just hours before the drab of winter browns and grays dominated the landscape. The ugliness was made new.</p>\n<p>As a child, I remembered the excitement of making the first footprints, first sled tracks, or even shoveling the first paths on the sidewalks or driveways. The reward of hot cocoa, and perhaps a just-baked cookie, was often&nbsp;part of the expectation after we&#8217;d broken into the frosty scene to our heart&#8217;s delight. Even without a fireplace, we could gather&nbsp;around the oven, warming our numbed fingers and toes as we waited expectantly&nbsp;for mother to finish the cocoa.</p>\n<p>Winter in the Midwest also reminded me&nbsp;of chilly thrills and spills. There was the joy&nbsp;of riding our steel runner wooden sleds&nbsp;down steep hills and even streets in our small town. As a youngster, I would gleefully jump onto the back of my father at the top of the hill near our home. It seemed like &#8220;forever&#8221; to the bottom of the gentle slope beside my home, every inch of the way filled with excitement. Dad steered the handles upfront, and I clung to his broad shoulders, screaming for effect as we hit unexpected bumps along the way. Though I knew we might&nbsp;take a tumble, I had ultimate trust in the outcome as I held on to my dad, the one I believed could make all of life go well.</p>\n<p>As an adult,&nbsp;I pulled&nbsp;the sleds of my own little ones and as they grew, we sledded any hills we could find when the snow fell. I wanted my children&nbsp;to have the same fond memories I did of winter. We became a skiing family, and that passion infused a new interest in the wintry cold. My feet ached, my fingers froze, and yet, to stand at the top of a mountain range in the Colorado Rockies was worth every discomfort ever experienced. The Creation of God before my eyes was breathtaking, and skiing was an adventurous way to be a part of such beauty.</p>\n<p>Over time, despite its beauty, I also learned how harsh and barren winter can be. The cold season brings&nbsp;punishing winds, stinging cold, and danger to wildlife as well as humans who are ill-prepared. Winter can be hard to endure, and seemingly endless some years. I personally find candles and fireplaces comforting with their glowing warmth and esthetic beauty. People use various ways to cope with the restrictive boundaries of winter &#8212; remedies for relieving the itch of cabin fever or simply &#8220;snow weariness&#8221; in the dark days.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on a deeper, analogical meaning of &#8220;season,&#8221; poets and writers have often alluded to the stages of human life. Admittedly, my years of &#8220;spring&#8221; have passed, those exciting years when everything continues to bloom and flourish in beauty and energy. Those were years of my youth in which mortal life appeared unending, full of promise and expectation, eyes on the next milestone. In the summer, I remained strong, able, and healthy with the promise of more good things to come. In the fall of life, my pace slowed, my children had grown, and I looked forward to their promises of new life and growth. Their milestones became mine vicariously. I knew my &#8220;winter&#8221; was to come, but I didn&#8217;t really ponder it. There were still plenty of projects to accomplish, friends to see, and life to live! If I let myself think about it, the final chapter of life on earth did seem not as far in the future as I once believed.</p>\n<p>When my parents passed into eternity, I had the opportunity of holding their hands in those final moments. I stood beside my mother, realizing that I was suddenly the matriarch of the family. I felt instantly orphaned. At that moment, I could not avoid the sight of my own mortality. How many more years would I have, and how should they be spent? How would my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, direct my paths? Would I obey and follow? What purposes would my life serve, however many days, months, or years were left? Was there some significance to this winter season? Was I to glory in pleasureful activities with more freedom to play? Or was there more to this end game?</p>\n<p>The good news is that our Creator God has provided purpose for His children in every single &#8220;season&#8221; of life, from conception to the grave &#8212; or to the arms of God in heaven. &nbsp;I have learned that as long as we have breath to breathe, we have life to live. If there are physical limitations, God has provided (the potential for) spiritual wisdom, which is an even greater gift. In seeking answers for this query of how to live joyfully in the &#8220;winter of life,&#8221; my eyes were opened to a fresh perspective. Just as we began, we should end. Jesus told us the greatest commandment in the Law:&#8221; <i>Matthew 22:37.</i> &#8220;&#8230; &#8216;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&#8217; This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: &#8216;Love your neighbor as yourself.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>These words of Christ are so simple, and yet so profound. If we walk in those great commandments, we can find peace and significance of purpose that I believe all human hearts yearn to know. Undeniably, I <i>have</i> lived through many seasons, but I have discovered that God is my source of strength, courage, peace and all spiritual blessings &#8230; through it all, even in the unpleasant and painful trials we encounter on Earth.</p>\n<p>I have a choice though! We all have a choice. God was purposeful in His creation, making certain that we could <i>choose</i> to love Him and follow His plans, <i>or not.</i> It&#8217;s called Free Will. Father God did not make His creation in such a way that they would be forced to walk according to His Divine Plans. What Father would want puppet children, forced into relationship like slaves? But, He promises to cover our sins like the beauty of new fallen snow when we make that choice to walk with Him.</p>\n<p>As for me, I choose to walk in faith until He calls me home to Heaven, Eternal Life, in the presence of the One who created it all. I invite you to find that same assurance, purpose, and peace by accepting His free gift of forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Invite Him to be the Lord of your life. If you are unsure how to accomplish this, talk to someone who is a Follower, or send a note here on the Blog and I will respond personally. By giving God the reigns of your life in exchange for a loving relationship with the Lord of all Creation, you will have everything you need for a life of blessing and purpose through <i>even</i> the winter of life.</p><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-25\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/23/winter/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-25\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/23/winter/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-25\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/23/winter/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-01-23T02:09:22.000Z","excerpt":"<p>The beauty of a new snowfall&nbsp;carried sweet remembrances that winter evening.

She was personable, well-dressed, and attractive. Keisha was already a mom, clearly a strong young woman who had managed to keep truckin&#8217; even after a breakup with her son&#8217;s father. Now in her mid-twenties, she worked, and was self-supporting, though she did have family in the area.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I never ask my parents for anything,&#8221; she said with pride in her voice. &#8220;I had never considered abortion as a life choice, at least not for me,&#8221; she said softening her tone. &#8220;But, I also told myself I would never go through another pregnancy by myself. I always said if I were to parent again, there <em>would</em> be an involved father.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keisha had indicated on her intake papers that she wanted abortion education. The nurse asked if she would like her to explain the different procedures and current state laws governing the procedure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, I need to learn my options. The love of my life, my little Brady who is now four, is all I can handle on my own. I really can&#8217;t raise another baby by myself.&#8221; As she slowly and distinctly enunciated her words, Keisha&#8217;s eyes filled to the brim with quickly flowing tears.</p>\n<p>After dobbing her eyes and regaining composure, she went on, breaking the tension with loving affirmation of her prized treasure, her son.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Brady is the best thing that ever happened to me,&#8221; she said, with a huge smile. &#8220;Life is complicated, you know? But, nothing makes the day better than when he runs up and tackles me with his big hugs!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am so glad you came in today, Keisha. You are still early in your pregnancy, and you won&#8217;t regret learning everything you can about your options before deciding.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I called some abortion clinics this week,&#8221; Keisha said, glancing down at the floor. &#8220;But, I hung up each time before I spoke with anyone. Then, I cried. Every time.&#8221; Looking up at the nurse and counselor, her eyes filled again. Restraining her emotions, she shifted the mood. &#8220;I even cried when I had to give my dog away,&#8221; she said with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Actually, I really don&#8217;t know that I can go through with this,&#8221; she confessed in a soft voice.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay to feel the weight of this decision, Keisha. This is a life with all the genetic DNA in place for its future, and a beating heart, even now. There is a lot to think about. Do you pray, Keisha?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes. I used to go to church with my grandma when I was little. I just got out of the habit after she passed away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;After you learn how the abortion procedure works at this stage of pregnancy, I encourage you to consider praying before you decide what to do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Keisha listened quietly, nodding her head in agreement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since you are almost eight weeks from conception, this is what a medical abortion will look like. First you will be given a drug at the clinic, and that will cause the baby&#8217;s heart to stop. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours later you will take another drug, at home, which causes cramping to expell the fetus and placenta. Please have someone with you, Keisha, if you do this because you may need help. Risks include hemorrhaging and a possibility that not everything would come out leaving you vulnerable to infection. You could also see identifiable parts of the fetus if you are past eight weeks. You need to be prepared.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Dear Father God,</em></p>\n<p><em>Keisha needs you now in a very special way. Make your love, forgiveness, and provision visible to this young mom. Show her other options that she can&#8217;t see as possibilities at this moment. She loves her little Brady with all of her heart, and with such a tenderness, even for her pet, she may experience a broken heart that she cannot begin to foresee right now. I pray that she will reach out to you for answers and a lifegiving decision that will bring her peace for her life and a healing resolution for a difficult situation.</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you, Lord, for being a Provider in our times of need and a Healer when we hurt. Even when we stray from Your truth and have not followed your will, You are ready to forgive and redeem our mistakes. Help Keisha now, Lord. In Jesus Name I pray.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-316\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/keishas-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-316\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/keishas-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-316\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/keishas-story/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-01-29T01:47:08.000Z","excerpt":"<p>Keisha, did you know?

Fingers are distinct from its body.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch has been said and written about a fetus being a part of the mother&#8217;s body, therefore subject to her decision to carry it or not. Science has shown that the fetus is being housed in the mother&#8217;s body, but it is not a part of her body. If you carry this analogy further, you learn that the first test-tube baby was conceived in a petri dish. Obviously, she wasn&#8217;t a part of her mother&#8217;s body when she was implanted in the womb anymore than she was a innate part of a petri dish when conception began there.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, in July 2000, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill (unanimously) saying that it would be illegal to execute a pregnant woman. Why, you ask? Well, the preborn child, a distinctly separate human being, was deemed to have his or her own inalienable right to life!\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-light-green-cyan-background-color\">We live in a culture with broad and disparate moral perspectives, and we have similarly and profoundly failed to be morally consistent.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/a-fetus-at-9-10-weeks-lmp/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/a-fetus-at-9-10-weeks-lmp/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-368\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/a-fetus-at-9-10-weeks-lmp/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-01-29T02:19:54.000Z","excerpt":"<p>The tiny embryo grows quickly.

In desiring to not break off a relationship, a woman may become vulnerable to the pressure of the father, someone who is not willing, or emotionally ready, to parent. However, the cruel reality is that often if a woman chooses to abort under pressure, the relationship she wants to protect becomes more at risk for failure. Consider the correlation found between induced abortion and the negative impact on your primary relationship &#8230; before you decide. Weigh the risks. Count the cost.&nbsp;</em> &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Jeremy, I can&#8217;t believe what you just said!&#8221; Ashlyn shouted into her cell phone. &#8220;You knew we weren&#8217;t using protection, and here we are. I am pregnant! With YOUR baby! And, all of a sudden, you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re ready to play daddy? Fine. Just fine.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ashlyn abruptly clicked her phone off. She knew she needed to calm down and think. It was Saturday, and she called her best friend, Ava. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Are you free to talk, Ava? I really need someone to process with,&#8221; Ashlyn said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Sure, Ashlyn, I&#8217;m just cleaning up around my apartment, and will be here until about 5 p.m. Come on over!&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, Ava. Jeremy is acting like a jerk. We are not children. We are both out of school and beginning our careers. Maybe we weren&#8217;t planning on starting a family right now, but we both knew the risks. He said he wanted to be with me &#8230; forever. So much for &#8216;forever,&#8217; right?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Did he ask you to have an abortion, Ashlyn?&#8221; Ava asked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He did. He even &#8216;volunteered&#8217; to pay for it. He even said he would go with me.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What a gentleman!&#8221; Ava said, her tone dripping with sarcasm. &#8220;What do you want to do, Ashlyn? Have you had time to even consider the consequences of this &#8230; on you, on Jeremy, your parents?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Oh, I would never tell my parents if I have an abortion. No, no, never! Leave them out of this picture.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What do you think Jeremy will do if you say you want to keep the baby?&#8221; Ava asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Tears began to well up in Ashlyn&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know. He said he wanted to travel with his job, and take every opportunity for promotion.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But, I really love Jeremy,&#8221; she added softly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Will you still love him the way you did before if you abort your baby?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silence. Quiet tears fell. Ava reached out her arms to give Ashlyn a hug. She held her while she sobbed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I loved Jeremy so much, Ava. I thought he would be my husband some day &#8230;&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And, if he doesn&#8217;t want to support you now &#8230; now that you are expecting his baby &#8230;?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ashlyn looked into Ava&#8217;s eyes and said nothing. It was clear that everything had changed. Just twenty-four hours ago, life was beautiful and carefree with a future filled with hope. Twelve hours ago, Ashlyn took a pregnancy test. The earth shook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dear&nbsp;Lord,</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ashlyn is in so much pain, and we know you&#8217;ve seen all the details of her story.

In one such study, the variables included perceptions of quality-of-life,  termination of relationship, sexual changes, aggression, and conflict.  A large number of <em>both</em> men (n=658) and women (n=906) were interviewed, and the samples were ethnically diverse. Interestingly, for  both men and women, if one had experienced an abortion in a previous relationship, there was a negative impact on the current relationship. The abortion  experience was associated with an increased risk for arguing about children when children came in to the picture. Females also reported an increased risk for sexual dysfunction, arguments concerning finances, and even the relatives, both his and hers. Though this study does not prove that this affect will be associated with every person who has experienced an induced abortion, it is clear that abortion <em>may </em>impact relationships in a negative way as a person tries to move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> <br>Coleman PK, Rue VM, Coyle CT.

I often see an analogous relationship between their instinctive behaviors and ours as humans. Interestingly, when I put them on a leash, no matter what the length, they strain to the end of it. I tell them, &#8220;No pull!&#8221; quickly making them aware of their limits. If the leash is 4 feet, 6 feet, or 20 feet long, their reaction is the same without training and correction. They want complete freedom without restraint. So do we. It&#8217;s a primary struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the very first creation account, we have testimony that a single boundary was given by Creator God in the midst of an incredible and most perfect place &#8211; Eden. Adam and Eve had no labor, no toil, no sweat &#8230; just the beauty of the Garden God had placed them in with provision and comfort. Ahhhh &#8230; such sweet contentment. But, wait. That&#8217;s not how the story goes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given only one limitation, and that given for their good, the humans decided that God really couldn&#8217;t have meant what He said. Surely not, the Tempter said! The Evil One was lurking about ready to sell deception to these first human children. He also had chafed at his role of being an angelic being, desiring to be God himself. Forever being dismissed from his original heavenly purpose, he has been up to no good ever since. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he said to Eve, &#8220;God merely wants to deny you the gift of being like Him, the ability to know good and evil.&#8221; Eve reasoned that this made sense: God wanted to deny them that delicious and beautiful fruit to protect His authority and omnipotence. Wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>God had higher purposes for his instructions. Not only had He created these human children with free will to choose, but He also did <em>not </em>want them to live forever in sin. He was protecting them from their own potential wrong choices. Oh, but they chafed against that simple restraint. They tugged at the proverbial leash until they broke free and had their way. Momentary freedom ultimately led to pain, sorrow, and death. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why, oh why, do we never see boundaries and limits as a gift, for our good and protection? When you say, &#8220;God wouldn&#8217;t give me THIS situation (you name it) if He didn&#8217;t think I could handle it,&#8221; are you sure He<em> gave</em> it to you? Or did you break the restraint to have your way instead of His highest and best? Or sometimes, it could be someone else&#8217;s sin that produced chaos in your life. Or it could be the condition of the fallen world splashing upon you, a child of God. Father God will see you through the storm, no matter the cause because God is love. Yet, should we examine the potential of our own failure to walk with Him before we assign God the<em> bla</em>me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creator of the Universe, Father God, is also Omniscient &#8211; One who knows our choices before we do. Yes, He is also a loving, forgiving Father even when we foil His best plans for our lives. When we turn from our wayward paths, He redeems our mistakes and even uses them to bless us &#8230; when we repent.</p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you don&#8217;t want to experience a U-turn, or feel that loving tug of the Father&#8217;s &#8220;leash,&#8221; choose wisely. If Father God has clearly expressed His will in His &#8220;Owner&#8217;s Manual,&#8221; the <em>Bible</em>, you can count the cost in advance by doing your own thing, by breaking free from His wisdom and guidance. &#8220;Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplines you,&#8221; Deuteronomy 8:5 <em>(NIV).</em>  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow the common expression, &#8220;Everything happens for a reason&#8221; omits an important truth. God has given us free will, and when we ignore His protective plans for living a healthy life, there are consequences. He does correct us just as I do, in love, to protect my precious pets. He will remind us &#8230; &#8220;No pull!&#8221; &#8230; as we strain against the &#8220;leash&#8221; He has provided to help us navigate. It&#8217;s our job to listen and follow. But, given all of the Providential Wisdom at your discretion, it IS always still your choice. You decide.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-432\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/02/19/stretching-the-limits/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-432\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/02/19/stretching-the-limits/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-432\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/02/19/stretching-the-limits/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-02-19T18:21:56.000Z","excerpt":"<p>Being the owner and &#8220;parent/caregiver&#8221; of two adorable Bichons, I am fascinated with their behaviors.

Abortion or parenting are the more popular choices. Disinformation abounds with lines blurred between foster children and adopted children. Many young people know little about adoption and what it looks like today.</p>\n<p>As one studies the changes in the culture over the past 75 years, a most obvious cultural shift is that single parenting is commonly accepted today.  Often people end up single parenting even if they were once married due to the high frequency of divorce. Finances can be challenging, but not impossible with many forms of social services to assist a single parent. Therefore, the question begs an answer: &#8220;Why would I consider going through a pregnancy, becoming attached to the little one in my body, and then hand it over to someone else?&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are similarities between adoption and abortion. Someone unprepared to parent can be relieved of that responsibility &#8212; by either choice. However, the glaring difference is that the baby is given life in adoption. In abortion, that little one, his or her God-given purposes, gifts, and talents are extinguished forever. An abortion decision is permanent and final with no replacement possibilities.</p>\n<p>Today there are many dimensions and opportunities in making an adoption plan. The doors have opened to biological mothers/fathers to have more involvement in their child&#8217;s future if they so choose. The extent of contact can be predetermined in the initial stages of planning. Perhaps a young mom will decide she only wants to receive updates and photos so she knows how her child is developing. Or maybe, she desires an open adoption in which she will spend time with her child, giving that child knowledge of who she is from the beginning of life. Some people feel that it is in the best interest of the child to grow up with an understanding that they have only one family, those who are responsible for raising them. Yet, having some contact with biological family has worked well for many adopted children and parents.</p>\n<p>Adoption has evolved over the years. It was once done in secret to protect both the biological mother&#8217;s future as well as the adoptive family&#8217;s. Legal rights of the biological mother were severed upon the decision to place the child into an adoptive home. The adoptive couple became the legal parents/guardians and even birth certificates were changed to represent the new family unit.  In the early 20th century, it was common to hide an adoption from a child who was often <em>never</em> told the truth about his or her biological family. Then, after &#8220;surprising truths&#8221; were discovered as the child became an adult, there was an emotional toll to resolve. By the middle of the century and beyond, social practices evolved. Adopted children were usually told &#8220;their stories&#8221; before they were even old enough to understand the meaning. Adopted babies learned that they were special and chosen by their adoptive parents. They were taught that their birth parent loved unselfishly by choosing parents who were better prepared to parent.</p>\n<p>In 2019, adoption still provides many opportunities for a parent who feels she is unable to parent. Yes, grief and loss may accompany carrying a child full term and relinquishing parenting to someone else. However, the child is alive, the parent <em>can</em> become involved, or in the least of contact, have the satisfaction of knowing her child is thriving. In abortion choices, there may be initial relief, but there can be also substantial risks: emotionally, relationally, spiritually, and even physically. And, that one little life has ended. Forever.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-478\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/05/02/adoption/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-478\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/05/02/adoption/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-478\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/05/02/adoption/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-05-02T01:35:03.000Z","excerpt":"<p>In the cultural/social climate of 2019, few women choose adoption as an unplanned pregnancy option.

The puzzle had been a gift created from family photos, each image represented a favorite memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shrugging her little shoulders, Cassie replied, &#8220;I know he&#8217;s here! I just need to look harder.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Look, Cass, is this Daddy&#8217;s eye and nose?&#8221; I asked, holding up a piece. &#8220;Yes, yes, I see him!&#8221; my sweet grandchild answered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was reminded that sometimes I, too, have searched for my Father&#8217;s &#8220;face&#8221; among the disassembled puzzle pieces of my life. I&#8217;ve even cried out. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; In those times of darkness, I have to trust and remember who my Heavenly Father is. Like Cassie, I need to remember to &#8220;look harder&#8221; for evidence of God&#8217;s presence, instead of fixating on the unsolved problem. It seems to be human nature to painfully focus on what is wrong, those missing pieces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet we have assurance that God has not abandoned us. In Romans 8:38-39, He comforts His children. &#8220;For I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God&#8217;s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow&#8211;not even the powers of hell can separate us from God&#8217;s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below&#8211;indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221; ((NLT). &nbsp;What an all-encompassing promise!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exodus explains that God&#8217;s face is hidden from view because He is so holy.&nbsp;&#8220;But you may not look directly at my face, for no one may see me and live,&#8221; Exodus 33:20 (NLT). The Bible is explicit. God is not withholding his presence because he is an unkind Father, but He is so sinless<i>&nbsp;</i>that we could not survive a face-to-face encounter.\n\nThus, enters Christ. He is why we <em>can</em> have relationship with this Holy God. Through the sacrifice of Christ, the penalty for&nbsp;<em>our</em> sins have been laid to rest, absolved, on the cross. Father God can now see&nbsp;us as forgiven and perfect in His sight! The gift of Christ made a way for us to be brought back into an intimate relationship with<em> perfect</em> Father God!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been given the promise of seeing Father God face to face &#8230; someday &#8230; in heaven. &#8220;And they will see his face, and his name will be written on their foreheads. And there will be no night there&#8211;no need for lamps or sun&#8211;for the Lord God will shine on them,&#8221; Revelation 22:3-5a (NLT). I will then be perfected, and though in awe, I&#8217;m sure, I will see Him clearly, face to face. As the song title says, &#8220;I can only imagine &#8230;&#8221; what that will be like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when I feel like young Cassie, searching for the comfort of my Father&#8217;s face and presence, I can say with the confidence of a child, I know He is with me. Look for His presence around you. Listen for His voice, and watch for evidence in all ways.\n\nAs you search for your Spiritual Father &nbsp;in the middle of your unsolved puzzle, know He is near. You can encounter His presence. &#8220;Come close to God, and God will come close to you,&#8221; James 4:8 (NLT). His desire is to comfort you with great love and compassion. Look up from your despair, and He will show His face when you need it most.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon

God&#8217;s promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone. The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>I have always loved flowers. From my earliest memories of planting marigold seeds with my sweet mama, flowers have been a beautiful part of my life. They make me smile on the gloomiest of days. Flowers have long inspired poets and artists. The great artist Claude Monet said, &#8220;I must have flowers, always, and always.&#8221;  Henry Ward Beecher, a clergyman and abolitionist of the 1880s said, &#8220;Flowers may beckon towards us, but they speak toward heaven and God.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Scripture also refers to flowers with frequency. Close your eyes and imagine a flower adorned garden in which God placed his first children. I&#8217;m sure it was decorated with an abundance of variety and a vast array of colors. In Luke 12:27, Jesus tells the disciples to consider how the lilies grow. He points out that even Solomon with all his wealth was not dressed like the beautiful flowers God created.</p>\n<p>However, unlike the Garden of Eden, with its natural mist to maintain moisture, my flowers must be tended. One hot summer day, as I watered my front flower beds, I glanced up to where once-bountifully blooming flower baskets were hanging.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh, NO! Look!&#8221; I cried to my husband. &#8220;They looked fine Friday!&#8221; I cried.</p>\n<p>My husband surveyed the damage, and suggested we soak them in a revival attempt. Sadly, the soaking was &#8220;too little, too late.&#8221; I knew it had been hot, but we had received three inches of rain mid-week. The last time I had assessed the baskets, they seemed healthy. Apparently, I had not been vigilant.</p>\n<p>We had been studying 2 Peter 1:5-8, Peter&#8217;s &#8220;formula&#8221; for living well as followers of Christ. Basically, Peter tells us if we attend to his plan, we will have certainty of being &#8220;productive and useful&#8221; to the Kingdom of God. We will grow spiritually strong, he says, when we add moral excellence to our faith. Peter unpacks other essentials that we need to achieve God&#8217;s promised blessings: knowledge, self-control, patient endurance, godliness, brotherly affection, and LOVE for everyone! Oh, how I long to have these virtues growing in me daily.</p>\n<p>The Lord spoke to my heart with a spiritual application from my pitiful dead flowers. It appeared that my plants went from thriving to dying &#8220;almost overnight.&#8221; I was shocked, in fact, with their quick demise. My judgment had lapsed when I assumed they didn&#8217;t need immediate attention. The result? Disappointing consequences.</p>\n<p>My loss of my flowers is a minor consequence compared to many of life&#8217;s unexpected detours. To live in a spiritually effective way, to receive the blessings God has prepared for me, I need to be watchful, attentive &#8230; <em>vigilant,</em> in fact. A person can&#8217;t simply throw together Peter&#8217;s hefty spiritual goals and expect instant attainment. Maybe this is what our Christian fathers have referred to as the &#8220;spiritual disciplines.&#8221; Goodness knows, my self-control needs hourly monitoring! Perhaps my lesson is that to acquire spiritual strength and blessing, I must <em>tend </em>to my daily progress.</p>\n<p>This does <em>not</em> equate spiritual<em> growth</em>  (sanctification) with &#8220;good works&#8221; to somehow earn salvation. &#8220;Earning salvation&#8221; is not Biblical. Eternal life in Heaven is freely given by grace through the gift of Jesus Christ. He took the penalty of my sin, providing a way for me to have a relationship with Father God.</p>\n<p>However, Peter admonishes us to &#8220;make every effort&#8221; to respond to God&#8217;s promises. My dead flowers remind me to be <em>vigilant</em> in this task. Join me. Pledge to yourself to be vigilant in seeking Holy Spirit empowerment. Why? so you can &#8220;finish well&#8221; in this race of life. I aim for the greatest of all treasures, to grow in the image and likeness of Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/03/the-virtue-of-vigilance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/03/the-virtue-of-vigilance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-635\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/03/the-virtue-of-vigilance/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-08-03T23:55:19.000Z","excerpt":"<p>Spiritual growth requires vigilance so we can be more useful in the Kingdom of God.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-635\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/03/the-virtue-of-vigilance/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-635\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/03/the-virtue-of-vigilance/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-635\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/03/the-virtue-of-vigilance/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","link":"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/03/the-virtue-of-vigilance/","slug":"the-virtue-of-vigilance"},{"id":"a48d7dfa-bca9-5593-a633-4f70c41171b7","title":"&#8220;STOP!&#8221;","tags":[],"author":1,"categories":[548286],"content":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><figcaption>\n\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone size-full wp-image-653\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bensonjj.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/clouds-cloudporn-weather-lookup-158163.jpeg?w=682&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"grey white clouds\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption>Photo by Pixabay on <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/grey-white-clouds-158163/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pexels.com</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us, including me, love sunshine. The old John Denver song (for those of you old enough to remember) comes to mind: &#8220;Sunshine on My Shoulders&#8221; of course &#8230; makes me happy! Somehow the sun has the power to transform a cold winter day from dreary to cheery. Sunshine delights the eyes as it illuminates and accentuates the early blooms of spring. Sunshine intensifies the glory of crimson and yellow fall leaves, leaving an onlooker breathless from its vibrant display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in real life, not every day is so perfectly beautiful and filled with light. Your &#8220;skies&#8221; may turn dark. Storm clouds might roll in hard and fast. &nbsp;If you are from Tornado Alley, like I am, you may run to take cover as the green-gray cloud soup drapes itself over the land, and tiny funnel-shaped structures dip and dance overhead. There are certainly vivid Bible stories depicting the fears and consequences of storms at sea. Think of dear old Jonah who was trying to escape God&#8217;s directives. The Lord sent a great wind and a storm so wicked that the sailors were all afraid their ship would break up, leaving them to drown in the sea. God needed to get Jonah&#8217;s attention. And, he used that storm to speak to Jonah&#8217;s heart. When storm clouds threaten, do you call on the Lord? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Jesus and his disciples were crossing the Sea of Galilee, a sudden and furious squall arose. (Mark 4:35-42) Waves crashed over the boat, nearly swamping it. The disciples thought they might die, yet Jesus slept in the stern of the fishing vessel until they awakened him. He fussed a bit at their unbelief. &#8220;Do you still have no faith?&#8221; he asked. But, <em>before he spoke</em>&nbsp;to the disciples, he got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, &#8220;Quiet! Be still!&#8221; Wow. Just like that. The storm subsided. The disciples were in disbelief even though they had been following him for awhile! Yet, they feared death and destruction in that moment, when they couldn&#8217;t see the sunshine, but felt the wind. Yet, Jesus was right there. He was with them in that boat. Do we ever doubt where He is during the storms, or do we remember He is <em>with us</em>? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know we cannot always rebuke every storm in our lives and see it instantly dissolve. Yet, I want to take this analogy one step further. Oftentimes, our storms are not physical or environmental. Sometimes, they take place in our heads and hearts &#8230; a heaviness, a loneliness, a lack of joy, a grief that doesn&#8217;t seem to end. I want to encourage you to take heart. Though you may not see miracles every day, Jesus did tell the disciples in John 14:12, &#8220;,,, <em>whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you feel some torment from your spiritual antagonist, Satan himself, put on your spiritual armor and stand your ground. In James 4:7 we are reminded to submit ourselves, to God. Then,&nbsp;<em>&#8220;Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&#8221;&nbsp;</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a bad dream a week ago and it was a reminder of this principle. A dark and shadowy cloud formation was following me. I noticed it but kept walking. Then, I began running. It followed relentlessly. In this dream, I suddenly turned around to face that fearsome thing, and shouted, &#8220;STOP!&#8221; And, it did!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know. This was a dream. There was no real threat to me or my loved ones. &nbsp;Yet, I do believe the Lord speaks to us in dreams. The dark cloud stopped in its tracks, and I, in joyful amazement, praised God. It was only a dream, but symbolic, no doubt. &nbsp;I will wear my spiritual armor (Ephesians 6:10-18). When I feel the darkness of the Enemy discouraging me from fulfilling God&#8217;s purposes, I will boldly proclaim, &#8220;STOP! In the name of Jesus!&#8221;&nbsp;I pray this imagery will be an encouragement to you as well. I pray that you won&#8217;t be overcome by the one who wants you to lose hope in the storms of life. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-646\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/28/stop-in-the-name-of-jesus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-646\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/28/stop-in-the-name-of-jesus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-646\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/28/stop-in-the-name-of-jesus/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-08-28T00:45:25.000Z","excerpt":"<p>A reminder that we don&#8217;t have to remain helpless in the face of our spiritual enemies.

SO alone that nobody cared what was going on in your life? No one understood what you were going through? No one was WITH you to help give you strength, encouragement, or even just a bit of compassion. Most of us have been there at one time or another.  There are so many instances when I have witnessed people in need of &#8220;withness.&#8221;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p> When I was a busy teacher and working mom, if I didn&#8217;t tune in to the running discourse of my then-kindergartener, she would reach up to my face with her little hands. She would place one hand on each cheek and turn my head to face her. Although I was answering (likely &#8220;um, uh-huh, sure, nice&#8221;), she knew when my mind and spirit were not WITH her. Those beautiful blue eyes spoke to mine, as she said, &#8220;Mama &#8230;&#8221; I knew I had not tuned in, and she needed me to do so. We all need someone to hear our hearts. Even if they don&#8217;t, or can&#8217;t, offer advice or change our circumstances, we desire someone to know us, and even share the joys in our journey. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, a friend told me that the word WITH had become her prayer to God. I didn&#8217;t get it. She didn&#8217;t feel a close togetherness, an emotional intimacy, with her church friends or even her husband. There was something missing &#8212; that key ingredient of a listening heart and truly concerned soul. Someone who cared enough to pray with her and to share the ups and downs of daily living. Her heart ached to be &#8220;known&#8221; and understood as well as the opportunity to know and understand others, if they would let her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon rereading the Twenty-third Psalm, my eyes were suddenly opened the other day. I knew that sweet and wonderful passage from childhood, but it had never spoken so clearly as it did that day. Being a timid flight passenger, and wary of all things weather-related to air travel, I pray for God&#8217;s peace upon boarding any flight. That day, I read, &#8220;I will fear no evil, for YOU ARE WITH ME.&#8221; Simple truth was illuminated. If there are fires, floods, storms, losses of any kind, God has promised to be WITH me. I need not fear. Just based on His presence with me &#8220;in the valley of the shadow of death,&#8221; I need not fear that thing, whatever it is. God promises a new dimension of reality that should replace fear with PRESENCE. I was nearly dancing in my seat-belted state! He was with me. God was really with me!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pray that you have others in your life who are intimately with you, but even if not, remember that promise. HE. IS. WITH. YOU. Let Him show His presence. Look for Him. HE. IS. WITH. YOU.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-678\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/09/27/for-you-are-with-me/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-678\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/09/27/for-you-are-with-me/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-678\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/09/27/for-you-are-with-me/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-09-27T13:54:27.000Z","excerpt":"<p>Have you ever felt like you were alone?

He had convinced his mama to buy them for me when they were shopping. The uniqueness of this spray of flowers was that each large flower head was drooping, bowing down from its stem, rather than standing upright.</p>\n<p>Maxwell explained with confidence that they were simply being sunflowers which are always looking for the sun. Of course, I graciously accepted his gift with an exclamation of his thoughtfulness. His daddy brought some filler plants in from the yard, which somewhat improved their countenance.</p>\n<p>In reflecting on the downcast sunflowers, I was taken back by the image above of the girl gazing in the opposite direction. If the flowers symbolically seek the Sun, shouldn&#8217;t we also seek the Son, Jesus, for our Source? Yes, of course. There are times and seasons when we may be tempted to think we&#8217;re capable of handling life all on our own. All is well, finances are secure, health is good, and we have done it all ourselves. We may pat ourselves on the back and expect our fans to applaud because we&#8217;re successfully sailing along in our strength. Who needs God anyway, one might ask?</p>\n<p>But, often that isn&#8217;t the way life works. You know that. I know that. Sometimes, <em>nothing </em>seems to go our way. So in those times we can misguidedly plunder through our days, lacking the Son in the messiness of life, lacking His strength, peace, and His Omnipotent wisdom for guidance. Scripture is replete with advice for living a complete and satisfying life, in the good times and bad.</p>\n<p>In Hebrews 12:1-2 we are reminded to <em>&#8220;&#8230; fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter or our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&#8221; </em>Yes, indeed, as the sunflowers seek the sun, we are advised to &#8220;fix our eyes &#8230;.&#8221; Where? On the Son.</p>\n<p>Psalm 34:5-6 tells us that<em> &#8220;Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame. This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles.&#8221; </em>More evidence that when we don&#8217;t look to ourselves, in our good old American independence, we will become radiant. We will be the sunflowers of humanity, with faces tilted upward with dignity, grace, and assurance. If you are feeling downcast today, pick up the Bible, and look to God&#8217;s Word to you. He will be your strength and radiance.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I need to seek the light of Christ &#8230;<em> daily.</em> Whenever I try to go it alone, I quickly become the wilty-headed sunflower, looking at the problems at my feet, instead of the Son&#8217;s LIGHT as my Source. I encourage all of us to not lose sight of God&#8217;s amazing gift, even in the hard times. When we &#8220;look up,&#8221; we will find the resources necessary to finish the race victoriously.

My father and I used to have such fun doing that. Later in life, I tried identifying optical illusions, searching for images that were not immediately recognizable. I confess, I don&#8217;t always discover the hidden objects as quickly as others. I have read that &#8220;seeing&#8221; what is hidden within the &#8220;visible&#8221; is a function of our perception, our ability to respond and <em>interpret</em> sensory information.</p>\n<p>In Scripture, we learn that God performed miraculous healing of physical eyes on a number of occasions so people could see. But, He also opened the eyes of humans to perceive things which were, at first, unseen in the natural. In one instance in 2 Kings, God encouraged the Israelites of the spiritual armaments He had prepared to protect them.</p>\n<p>In 2 Kings 6:16, the Lord encouraged the servant of Elisha in this way. The king of Syria was making war against Israel, and had sent a great army specifically to capture Elisha. &#8220;And Elisha prayed and said, &#8220;Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see,&#8221; (2 Kings 6:17 KJV). The servant had seen the physical presence of the enormous threat against them &#8230; with his own eyes. He was afraid of what seemed to be Elisha&#8217;s certain death. But God intervened and opened the servant&#8217;s eyes. He suddenly saw God&#8217;s army, horses, and chariots of fire all around Elisha, a compelling counterforce.</p>\n<p>God allowed the vision, the spiritual revelation, so they would regain courage in face of a seemingly insurmountable Enemy. At first, they had only seen with their physical eyes, and the threat was real. Yet, there was more provision behind the scenes. God had His invisible army, even more powerful than the Syrian forces prepared to defend His children.</p>\n<p>We live in a physical world, yet as humans with a mind, body, and spirit nature, why should we be surprised that there might be more to &#8220;see&#8221; in any given circumstance? Are we looking for God&#8217;s spiritual viewpoint when we face our trials and &#8220;insurmountables&#8221;? We often cannot see more than the present circumstances, and when those are painfully difficult, we lose heart.</p>\n<p>King David prayed to the Lord: &#8220;Open my eyes that I may see wondrous things from Your law,&#8221; (Psalm 119:18 KJV). Maybe we would be wise to pray the Lord open our eyes so we can see things in a dimension that God sees. What might we be missing by not praying that prayer? Maybe we need courage in times of attack. Perhaps, we don&#8217;t see the invisible forces He has already provided for us when we think we are alone.</p>\n<p>God made it clear that He wants a relationship with us. He loved us while we were yet far from Him, out doing our own thing, apart from His will. How do we know this?  He sent Jesus, His Son, to take the penalty of our sins so our most perfect, loving God could once again walk with us and talk with us as He had originally planned. After that, it was left to us to choose to align our lives by asking forgiveness, and accepting His free gift of relationship. We can be confident in our prayers that God is for us. He chose not to stay apart from us, and made a way for us to have relationship again after sin had, by its very nature, separated us from His Perfect Love.</p>\n<p>As the worship song lyrics by Michael W. Smith affirms, &#8220;Open the eyes of my heart, Lord, Open the eyes of my heart, I want to see You, I want to see You &#8230;&#8221; Let Him show you the spiritual dimension of life, tearing back the curtain of our physical and mental limitations. &#8220;I want to see You, Lord.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=open+the+eyes+of+my+heart+lord+michael+w+smithhttps://\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=open+the+eyes+of+my+heart+lord+michael+w+smithhttps://</a></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/11/30/open-the-eyes-of-my-heart-lord/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/11/30/open-the-eyes-of-my-heart-lord/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-710\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/11/30/open-the-eyes-of-my-heart-lord/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-11-30T02:25:17.000Z","excerpt":"<p>Did you ever &#8220;find&#8221; animals and shapes in the clouds when you were a child?

In the midst of all the gala events, those of us who celebrate the birth of Christ also diligently try to prepare our hearts for the meaning of Christmas. We don&#8217;t want the priceless &#8220;reason for the season&#8221; to get buried in an avalanche of gift wrap, bows, and parties. Sometimes we become desperate for a moment of quiet reflection while busily completing our to-do lists. Cards? Check. Gifts? Check. Food prep? Check. Gifts wrapped &#8230; well, maybe by midnight Christmas Eve if all the toys and bikes are properly assembled?</p>\n<p>I will never forget an unusual Christmas I experienced eight years ago. I learned more spiritual truth in that unique celebration than any other in my lifetime. It was Christmas Eve. I was all alone &#8230; well almost. I was with my eighteen-month-old grandbaby, but she was barely talking, and her bedtime was at seven p.m.</p>\n<p>I can still hear my daughter&#8217;s voice on the phone &nbsp;just a few days before Christmas. Sadly, we were across the continent from each other, from the east to the west coast. Her baby boy had been admitted to Children&#8217;s Hospital with congestive heart failure. He was born with a sizable hole in his heart, but the cardiologist was hoping he could grow a little more before surgery.&nbsp;&#8220;Mom, I need you. NOW,&#8221; she said breathlessly. Our eighteen-month-old granddaughter needed care. Her parents needed to be with our six-week-old grandson who was now immediately scheduled for open heart surgery.</p>\n<p>I hopped the next flight out while my husband stayed home to welcome another daughter and her family who were driving from out of state to spend Christmas with us. It was hectic. It wasn&#8217;t planned. It was scary. So much was at stake, and naturally, our attention was diverted from the usual Christmas traditions. We fervently prayed Psalm 91 prayers for our baby whose life was on the line. We asked everyone we knew to pray for this tiny one, his mommy and daddy, and the medical team into whose hands his life was entrusted.</p>\n<p>Christmas Eve arrived, and my adorable little toddler&#8217;s scheduled naps, meals, and bedtime negated a church service. At dusk, I loaded my little blonde bundle in her wagon, and we began a Christmas Eve walk through the neighborhood. In the simple expression of the Whos of Whoville (from <em>The Grinch</em>) when Christmas was stripped of its busyiness and trappings, I still had worship for the One it was all about. In simplicity. I sang every Christmas Carol I had ever learned &#8212; one baby girl, me, and songs of worship from ages past. My heart was full, and I felt the peace that passes all understanding. Not my peace as my heart was anxious. His peace.</p>\n<p>Why did I have peace when our circumstances were filled with such scary possibilities? Just as Mary sang, the young mother of Jesus, my heart was filled with praise for the Mighty One, my God, my Savior. &#8220;My soul glorifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant&#8221; (Luke 1:46-47 NIV). Christ&#8217;s coming so I could have a relationship with Holy God was the greatest gift <em>ever</em>. What we were celebrating wasn&#8217;t dependent on traditions.</p>\n<p>As one with family scattered across the country, it&#8217;s easy to reminisce. There were once hectic holidays with large family gatherings with our own little ones, their grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. I remember the chaos and fun with fondness.&nbsp;Yet, sometimes it takes having all of our usual customs stripped away to see the greater treasure.</p>\n<p>I will never forget the love and quiet reflection I felt on that unusual Christmas Eve. It helps me step back into time, and imagine the fear mixed with blessing that the young Mary experienced. &#8220;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests&#8221; (Luke 2:14 NIV). May you also know His peace and presence this Christmas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social

&#8220;planner.&#8221;  I like to know where I&#8217;m going, literally, figuratively, and spiritually. When I don&#8217;t understand the course ahead, I feel the tension of the limbo state, or as I call it, the Great Unknown. As one who likes to see where she&#8217;s going, I realize that some would castigate my desire with the label &#8220;Control Freak!&#8221; I don&#8217;t personally recognize this trait in my everyday life, but regardless, I will accept the label in stride and realize there<em> are </em>consequences.<em> What I do know</em>, as one who yearns for God&#8217;s way, I must relinquish my desires to His. He knows best, not me, and in this, I am certain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I take great comfort from the often quoted Scripture in Jeremiah 29:11: &#8220;For I know the plans I have for you, plans to give you hope and a future,&#8221; (NIV). So, aha! My heart leaps with joy. God has plans too, and they are good plans <em>for me</em>. Why would I insist on doing my own thing when the God of the Universe  wants to show me His way? His wisdom is superior, so shouldn&#8217;t I look, listen, and walk in it? Sounds like an unbeatable plan, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, on a long road trip recently, I was reminded of how easily I can be redirected. The &#8220;voices&#8221; that call to us, distract us, and deter us are everywhere. So many daily distractions, even the normal life routines, can carry us off course to prevent us from obtaining our God-inspired purpose. I was driving and listening to our GPS for directions to our destination. My husband was sitting behind me in the backseat, keeping our pets content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it went. &#8220;Siri,&#8221; our voice on the GPS, kept issuing orders to me: &#8220;Take a left at the next &#8230;.&#8221; My husband, with a calm, but authoritative tone, said, &#8220;Ignore her, and keep going straight ahead.&#8221; It happened three times just like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I drove along, trying to ignore the GPS and trust in my husband&#8217;s judgment, I thought how similar this is to our spiritual journey. The Lord has good plans, <strong>straight ahead,</strong> but something makes me turn from that course. Distractions come at me daily, and some are very winsome and attractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the GPS wanted me to go, I don&#8217;t know, nor probably ever will. She was so insistent. I paid attention to the clear directions from the voice behind me. I had reason to trust the man saying, &#8220;Stay the course.&#8221; I know his character. I know from experience how much better his internal navigation is than my own. (I can get turned around in a heartbeat.) We had no problems when I followed his directions, and we soon arrived safely at our planned destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this metaphorical analysis works for you as it did me, perhaps we can become better &#8220;followers&#8221; and learn to stay on task. When I come face to face with my Lord in Heaven, I want Him to know I tried to follow as the Psalmist writes: &#8220;My steps have held to your paths; my feet have not stumbled,&#8221; (Psalm 17:5, NIV). I know I will not do this perfectly, but He also knows I am mortal. Grace, mercy, and forgiveness are mine in salvation through Christ.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-765\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/06/where-are-you-going/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-765\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/06/where-are-you-going/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-765\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/06/where-are-you-going/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2020-02-06T20:05:04.000Z","excerpt":"<p>I am a self-admitted &#8220;planner.&#8221; I like to know where I&#8217;m going, literally, figuratively, and spiritually.

It&#8217;s difficult to imagine how a single cell could become a super-powered &#8220;apparatus&#8221; with abilities far surpassing mechanical responses in only a few months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me take you through an overview of the steps. After only three weeks from conception, chemical messages are telling some of the new cells to become the building blocks of the human brain. In only four weeks from conception, the brain has developed into organized structures. By five weeks after the moment of conception, the brain neurons begin communicating to the muscles, and movement begins. From the seventh to twenty-eighth week, the brain neurons seem to &#8220;explode&#8221; at the multiplication rate of 250,000 per minute! Ultrasounds show that hand dominance begins at seven weeks from conception. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Memory functions begin by twenty-nine weeks. Late term fetuses have a capacity for remembering the sounds and sensations experienced inside the womb. Songs sung and stories read are later recognized with interest by the infant after birth. The fetus has been listening to his or her mother&#8217;s voice and will easily relate to it after birth. One could say, without a stretch of the imagination, that learning is happening ten weeks before a normal full term birth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no single milestone to determine when consciousness begins. This realization makes a case for us to do what we can to protect this little one, from conception to birth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These facts are attributed to Katrina Furth, PhD.

Many voices in our culture believe women&#8217;s rights prevail in choosing to carry a pregnancy to its conclusion, or abort its development. A parallel mindset is the importance of protecting animals from pain. I agree that we should provide humane treatment for all of God&#8217;s creation. However, I have to ask why human life shouldn&#8217;t at least hold the same value as the animals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s turn to the research to see if there is any evidence of fetal pain and when it is observed. Since pain is subjective, even for fully formed adult humans, it would be helpful for to look at how doctors determine pain in infants. Young babies cannot communicate verbally or even point to a pain scale to tell how badly something hurts. However, babies <em>are </em>wired to let people know things are not &#8220;A-OK.&#8221; They grimace, cry, writhe, and withdraw from any perceived painful object.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prenatal surgeries have been helpful in providing information about fetal sensitivity to pain.  Scientists use several clues to rate the ability of a developing fetus to feel pain. Similar to more mature human life, the fetus shows signs of pain through facial grimaces as well as the reflexive response to pull away from objects they sense threaten them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To determine the degree of pain felt in utero, neuroscientists have measured the activity of <em>pain receptors</em> and <em>stress hormones.</em> The receptors are found throughout the body and quickly respond to potentially damaging events like high heat, extreme cold, injury, and inflammation. Pain receptors and stress hormones can be monitored and measured long before a fetus or infant can rate his pain sensation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Some proponents of abortion say that the brain must have complex connections between the thalamus and cortex to feel pain, which occurs around twenty-four weeks after conception. However, recent studies have shown that adults <em>without a cortex</em> can feel pain, invalidating this argument.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As early as six weeks after conception, the tiny fetus, measuring only 1.5 inches long, will spontaneously move away from anything that touches its mouth where pain receptor cells first develop. By eighteen weeks after conception, the entire body is covered by pain receptor cells.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By measuring stress hormones in the bloodstream, scientists have noted a stress response to a painful procedure as early as eighteen weeks after conception. For this reason, since the 1980s, doctors have advised using anesthesia and pain management for fetal surgeries. Why would doctors use anesthesia if there was no evidence that a fetus feels pain? Doctors have observed that pain management promotes faster recovery post surgery. And, then there is the ethical reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I must ask everyone who reads this, regardless of your views on abortion, to consider the ethics involved in suctioning or dismembering a fetus without any anesthesia. Since we have powerful campaigns to apply ethics to protecting animals, which have much less complex nervous systems and brain capacity than a human life, should we not at least protect these young ones from such a destructive end without any intervention? Even if you staunchly stand for a woman&#8217;s right to &#8220;choose,&#8221; should not a young one in utero be given the respect animals are?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of us who believe human life is made in the image of a Creator God, we need to be informed and able to provide scientific answers to those who believe a fetus is a mere glob of cells. The Bible tells us human beings  are privileged with a spirit life, unlike the animals in our creation. We may not persuade others of this understanding without an opening of their spiritual &#8220;eyes.&#8221; However, we can at least argue for humane treatment in the same way pro-choice advocates stand for the ethics of animal treatment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, check out my source: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"kYzwKew5Mt\"><a href=\"https://lozierinstitute.org/team-member/katrina-furth-ph-d/\">Katrina Furth, Ph.D.</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Katrina Furth, Ph.D.&#8221; &#8212; Charlotte Lozier Institute\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://lozierinstitute.org/team-member/katrina-furth-ph-d/embed/#?secret=kYzwKew5Mt\" data-secret=\"kYzwKew5Mt\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> </p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-807\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/08/does-a-fetus-feel-pain/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-807\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/08/does-a-fetus-feel-pain/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-807\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/08/does-a-fetus-feel-pain/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2020-02-08T21:07:46.000Z","excerpt":"<p>Though many do not even inquire, perhaps this is a question that deserves an answer.

I looked up to find the little creature balancing on a power line. I smiled with gratitude. Flashbacks flooded my mind with the times God has comforted me with that same peaceful <em>coo-coo</em> &#8230; often when I needed it the most. I&#8217;m not superstitious about signs in nature, but I know how His magnificent creation often speaks to my heart. Many writers address how we can best get through the tough times. And, it&#8217;s true that we will experience trials. What about the times we feel the presence of God? What about the quiet, still moments when the &#8220;noise&#8221; of life doesn&#8217;t demand every inch of our attention? Do we take time to listen? Are we even aware of the Creator&#8217;s desire to have communion with us, His children?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trials May Come</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1 Peter 1:6 (NIV) we are told &#8220;though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.&#8221; 1 Thessalonians 3:3 goes even further by telling us we are <em>destined </em>for them (these trials). That&#8217;s certainly not the kind of good news I relish, but it seems to be a natural flow of life &#8230; for me, my family, and my friends. Yet, I take courage in knowing this earthly dwelling is temporal, and for this short time, our spiritual enemy has domain. We can rejoice knowing there will be no more sorrow, no more tears in our eternal home, Heaven. We will forever enjoy a beautiful intimacy with Father God, our Creator. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where Is God?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing this dichotomy, I have taken a deeper look at the 23rd Psalm. It reminds me again that God will be <em>with me </em>as I walk through the valleys on earth. He assures me He is present right in the middle of the mess of my life. It is my job to look for and listen for Him. In addition, Scripture says, God as my Shepherd &#8220;makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, (Psalm 23:2, NIV).&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Restoration</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I love how God <em>makes me lie down</em>. I still remember as a little girl when my mom insisted I lie down, especially on a hot summer day. Didn&#8217;t she understand how busy I was? I had serious playing to do. Books to read. Friends to see. Skating. Biking. Yet my mom knew how I was made, and how much happier I would be if I rested. God knows when I need to have a &#8220;timeout&#8221; from my circumstances. What happens when He leads me to those still waters? Big stuff. He restores me. I become refreshed, and renewed from the chaffing of the rougher situations. I become stronger and more able to live victoriously even through the troubles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I take stock of my own testimony of faith, I stop to think about the times when God has intervened and set me in a quiet place. They may not have looked like still waters, but they were evident and restorative. A deep breath of peace. They are times when I sensed God&#8217;s presence. Sometimes, such experiences are as fleeting as the song of a dove, or a hug from a child. But regardless of the time, those memories linger as reminders of God&#8217;s care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>He is Speaking </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think for a minute about your own life. Everyone has ups and downs, mountaintops and valleys, joys and sorrows.  I would encourage you to look for those precious times when you have been able to stop to breathe, even in the midst of chaos. I pray that you have felt reminders of God&#8217;s love and comfort. Look for Him to show up when you need Him most. He may want you to lie down in green pastures. Listen for Him speaking to your heart.  </p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-832\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/28/green-pastures-still-waters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-832\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/28/green-pastures-still-waters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-832\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/28/green-pastures-still-waters/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2020-02-28T04:49:19.000Z","excerpt":"<p>Are You Listening?

When we first heard about Covid-19, fear ripped across our land. What untold millions would be impacted by this new and deadly disease? We listened to the news ad nauseum; enormous numbers of people would succumb, they said,&nbsp;calculated on little known reports coming from other countries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were vulnerable.&nbsp;As the curtailing of a &#8220;normal&#8221; American lifestyle became our status quo, I prayed and read my Bible. I found scriptures which calmed my own troubled heart, and wanted to share them. Yet, I felt scattered, and struggled to think I had anything of value to add to this conversation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was suddenly thrust into the quest for basic supplies: Sam&#8217;s Club in the wee hours of the morning, online shopping (forget the sales) requiring curbside pickup, discovering many items were limited for purchase, or there were none at all. Finding toilet paper became a central topic of conversation among friends and family, sometimes as a joke, sometimes as a serious point of desperate need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">I prayed for America and its leadership daily. I prayed and still pray for our nation to seek God&#8217;s will in this time of stopping our usual endeavors. Yet, in agreement with others, I don&#8217;t pray for us to  return to &#8220;normal.&#8221; Why? Because as a whole,<em> our culture has turned its back on God.</em> The Biblical roots of our nation have been replaced by secular humanism and &#8220;tolerance&#8221; of most everything &#8230; but Christianity.&nbsp;Long held truths and foundational American beliefs have been challenged as wrong, outdated, or simply problematic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">So where are we in this limbo state? American life = busy. Everyone is busy. If we are busy, life is as it should be goes the mantra. Children are busy. Parents are scrambling to keep up with jobs and &#8220;busy children.&#8221; Even many seniors keep busy. Some are chasing all the to-do&#8217;s on their bucket lists or looking for ways to find comfort in their final years.&nbsp;The enemy of our souls wants to <em>keep</em> us busy. Then there is no time to ponder the deeper things, <strong>the things that truly matter when nothing else does. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this life is over, will you have a relationship with the God of the universe? Are you grounded in a faith that assures you will live your eternal life in a heavenly place, a place where there are no more tears and sorrow? Your spirit&nbsp;<em>will</em> live eternally. But do you know where? In Psalm 46:10, God speaks his truth over us busy ones: &#8220;Be still, and know that I am God.&#8221; One day when you face your own mortality, this will be the only thing you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I face the Coronavirus head on, I know it has been a disrupter. On a lighter level it has stopped me from pursuing some of my present goals. I halted what had been pressing projects to sew masks for family and friends. It caused me to learn how to maintain relationships through technology. It forced me to learn new ways to gather food and supplies without entering a store. It has temporarily stripped our economy, and while the government prints money, we wonder how it will ever be repaid. And, most deeply, my heart aches as I grieve the loss of a sister-in-law who was struck down by this dreaded contagion. But, God. He has her in his care at this very moment. Because of her relationship with Jesus Christ, I can peacefully release her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yes, I have hope.</strong> God is sovereign over all things. If you believe there is a Creator, He is a power we cannot fully grasp: omniscient, omnipotent, and eternal, for starters. But, we know a lot about Him, and His will is for our good. Will this pause in life be something God can use for good in my life?   What will I do with this pause in life? He makes clear from the beginning of scripture to the last page, he desires a relationship with the people he created. He <em>made</em> us for relationship. He loves you. He loves me. <em><strong>It is God himself who is the &#8220;lifter of my head&#8221; when sorrows make me downcast.</strong> </em>He is for me, not against me. He has a good plan for my life, and promises an eternal home filled with beauty and joy. He calls me to come near; he awaits patiently when I am lost in earthly &#8220;busyness.&#8221; He calls us to come <strong><em>now.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>&#8220;So do not fear, for I am with you. Don&#8217;t be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.&#8221; Isaiah 41:10 (NIV)</strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-886\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/05/01/the-lifter-of-my-head/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-886\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/05/01/the-lifter-of-my-head/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-886\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/05/01/the-lifter-of-my-head/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2020-05-01T23:53:17.000Z","excerpt":"<p>When the world is knocked off its pins, don&#8217;t you wonder what will happen next?
