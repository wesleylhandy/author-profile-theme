If you are not ready to parent, and you believe it is in your best interest not to try, there is still another option beyond abortion. You will not be parenting now, and you can continue working or going to school. You can continue the goals you had before this unplanned pregnancy. It IS a significant decision that involves loss and grief, but not one that ends a life. You can even experience the joy of knowing your child if you choose to do so.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;What choice?&#8221; Liv cried out. &#8220;There is a no good choice!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Twenty-year-old Liv had just found out she was pregnant, which was certainly not in her plans. After taking multiple pregnancy tests, she knew she needed help.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I sure don&#8217;t want HIM in my life,&#8221; she said to her friend Talia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tell me about <em>&#8216;him,</em>&#8216;&#8221; Talia said, prompting another tirade from Liv.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He completely misrepresented himself on social media. This guy is so mixed up. Last week, he even said he was thinking of suicide.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Talia didn&#8217;t interrupt, but listened intently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He seemed so together and strong, when we first met, but I really wouldn&#8217;t want him to parent. The irony of it all.  You know how I&#8217;ve wanted to have a child. So now I have one. But, I will have to do this alone, and you know, I&#8217;m not really financially ready for that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is something to take your time with, Liv. Your choice is going to have long-lasting  effects for you &#8230; and that little one,&#8221; Talia replied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You know, Talia. I&#8217;ve always wanted to feel what it would be like to having a baby growing inside me. But, I really can&#8217;t take on raising a child right now!&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Do you know anything about adoption?&#8221; Talia asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, not really.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some ways, it offers the same relief as an abortion,&#8221; Talia offered.</p>\n<p>Liv sat quietly for a few minutes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know it would give the baby a future. Most likely a better life than I can give it,&#8221; Liv said thoughtfully. &#8220;But, could I go through with it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You are a brave, Liv, to even think about these possibilities,&#8221; Talia said, giving her friend a big hug.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Lord, I pray for Liv and all the young women facing her decision. Help them to see beyond the moment of turmoil they face. Open their eyes to the reality that you have purpose and meaning for this little life. Let Liv know that You will be there through it all if she puts her trust in You. In Jesus Name, Amen.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-470\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/04/29/i-have-a-choice/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-470\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/04/29/i-have-a-choice/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-470\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/04/29/i-have-a-choice/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2019-04-29T22:36:19.000Z","id":"147a79bd-13d3-5bb9-a512-3b9a1aa9b2ac","link":"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/04/29/i-have-a-choice/","modified":"2019-04-29T22:41:41.000Z","title":"I Have a Choice?","tags":[46912016],"slug":"i-have-a-choice"}},"pageContext":{"postID":"147a79bd-13d3-5bb9-a512-3b9a1aa9b2ac"}}}
