With completely separate DNA from its biological parents, the baby&#8217;s heart can be seen on an ultrasound at 6 weeks from the first day of the mother&#8217;s Last Monthly Period. By the time it is 9 1/2 weeks from the LMP, the little one can even hiccup! Fingers are distinct from its body.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch has been said and written about a fetus being a part of the mother&#8217;s body, therefore subject to her decision to carry it or not. Science has shown that the fetus is being housed in the mother&#8217;s body, but it is not a part of her body. If you carry this analogy further, you learn that the first test-tube baby was conceived in a petri dish. Obviously, she wasn&#8217;t a part of her mother&#8217;s body when she was implanted in the womb anymore than she was a innate part of a petri dish when conception began there.\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, in July 2000, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill (unanimously) saying that it would be illegal to execute a pregnant woman. Why, you ask? Well, the preborn child, a distinctly separate human being, was deemed to have his or her own inalienable right to life!\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-light-green-cyan-background-color\">We live in a culture with broad and disparate moral perspectives, and we have similarly and profoundly failed to be morally consistent.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-368\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/a-fetus-at-9-10-weeks-lmp/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-368\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/a-fetus-at-9-10-weeks-lmp/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-368\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/a-fetus-at-9-10-weeks-lmp/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","uri":"/2019/01/29/a-fetus-at-9-10-weeks-lmp/","link":"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/29/a-fetus-at-9-10-weeks-lmp/","date":"2019-01-29T02:19:54","modified":"2019-01-29 02:29:12","author":{"name":"Joan C.
