In one such study, the variables included perceptions of quality-of-life,  termination of relationship, sexual changes, aggression, and conflict.  A large number of <em>both</em> men (n=658) and women (n=906) were interviewed, and the samples were ethnically diverse. Interestingly, for  both men and women, if one had experienced an abortion in a previous relationship, there was a negative impact on the current relationship. The abortion  experience was associated with an increased risk for arguing about children when children came in to the picture. Females also reported an increased risk for sexual dysfunction, arguments concerning finances, and even the relatives, both his and hers. Though this study does not prove that this affect will be associated with every person who has experienced an induced abortion, it is clear that abortion <em>may </em>impact relationships in a negative way as a person tries to move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> <br>Coleman PK, Rue VM, Coyle CT.
