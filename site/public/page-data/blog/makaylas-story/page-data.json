Yet, amazingly, it contains all the genetic coding that determines every detail of the newly created LIFE: hair and eye color, the unique lines of fingerprints, physical appearance, gender, the mature height, and even skin tone. Wow.</p>\n<p><strong>Psalm 139:13</strong> <em>“For You created my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; You works are wonderful, I know that full well.”</em></p>\n<p>The young nineteen-year-old sat quietly listening as the nurse explained that her pregnancy test in the clinic was positive … just as it had been at home. Makayla had taken three different tests that week. Each time, holding her breath, she watched as the test silently screamed. “Positive.” “Positive.” <em>“Positive!”</em></p>\n<p>Tears rolled down her sun bronzed cheeks as the news confirmed her fears. Why had she been swept away with summer love, she wondered? She had plans. She wanted to finish school. She dreamed of becoming a nurse someday. Having a baby was <em>not</em> in the picture. Would Kevin even still be a part of her life? They loved each other, but would they stay together? What would her parents say? She knew they would be very disappointed. But, disappointment was the least of their response, she was sure.</p>\n<p>“What are your plans for your pregnancy, Makayla?”</p>\n<p>Startled back from her own internal musings, Makayla looked down. “I need to have an abortion. I can’t have a child. I can’t be a single parent.”</p>\n<p>“Let’s talk for a few minutes, Makayla. You don’t have to make a decision now. You don’t have to decide anything even this week. But, you do need to have the facts about such a life-changing decision.”</p>\n<p>“I must have an abortion.”</p>\n<p>“We can give you education about what that means, Makayla, but take time to breathe and think about your options today. You know there are options, right?”</p>\n<p>“No, I don’t have any options. I cannot have this … this …. I cannot be a parent now …”</p>\n<p>As the counselor waited quietly, Makayla did breathe. And her tears ran down her face as she struggled to find a way to say what was on her heart.</p>\n<p>“I love children. I just can’t have a baby now,” she said, hesitantly. “Later, I can have children.”</p>\n<p>The counselor said that she understood how overwhelming everything must feel. “As you think about your future, and your future plans, it will help you to have some facts so you can make an informed decision, Makayla.”</p>\n<p>She nodded in agreement.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Lord, </em></p>\n<p><em>Please help Makayla. In her state of fear and anxiety, she needs to find You. She needs to know You, and to see Your provision as she walks in accord with Your will and purposes. Help her understand the truth about the Innocent One growing in her womb, and how precious it is in Your sight.</em></p>\n<p><em> In Jesus’s Name, amen.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-261\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/14/makaylas-story/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-261\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/14/makaylas-story/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-261\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/01/14/makaylas-story/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","excerpt":"<p>Makayla’s Story Makayla, did you know?
