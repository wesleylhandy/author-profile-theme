You have set your glory in the heavens.&#8221;</em> Psalm 8:1</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Have you ever felt small as you looked into the night skies, stood on a mountaintop, or gazed into what seems like an endless sea from the shoreline? My human life, which is of utmost importance to <em>me</em>, is but an infinitesimal dot in one unfathomable universe &#8230; among many universes. In Psalm 8:3, David, the Psalmist, raises the question with this:</span> <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em>&#8220;When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?&#8221; </em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">(<em>NIV) </em></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><span style=\"color: #000000;\">[Enjoy listening to and watching this musical expression of Psalm 8:3 on Youtube:  </span></em></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/6_f0aOp0EPE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/6_f0aOp0EPE</a> ]</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Scriptures proclaim His creativity in Psalm 104: 24: <em>&#8220;How many are your works, Lord! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.&#8221;</em>  When I view the intricate details of nature, I am in awe. My heart is stirred at the exquisite pinks, reds, and yellows of a setting sun, at times dispersing its glory into clouds and reflecting waters.  Upon delighting in the scent of honeysuckle or a delicate rose bloom, I am humbled by God&#8217;s meticulous design. The calming song of a dove&#8217;s &#8220;cooooo-coooo,&#8221; or a lyrical human voice can lift my spirits even in turbulent times. How can I hold a newborn baby, so helpless, yet brimming with potential, and <em>not</em> see His works? I have only to let myself see, feel, hear, and touch what is all around me, and it becomes evident that God has allowed us glimpses of His Glory <em>now</em>. I can only imagine what Heaven will be as we then gaze upon the One who is the Creator!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> It would take greater faith than I have to believe that my world came into being from some astonishing accident of nuclear particles. Or that the complexity of human life evolved from amoeba emerging from its watery habitat. Even the precision of the tilt of the Earth as it rotates, scientists say, is &#8220;just about right&#8221; (like perfect?) for advanced life to flourish. Such a &#8220;coincidence&#8221;?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is no wonder that I am overwhelmed that God, The One who has formed not only my &#8220;tiny&#8221; yet miraculous life, but the whole of all universes, should care for me. &#8220;But God,&#8221; I ask. &#8220;<i>How </i>can you care about <em>me</em>?&#8221; I am but one among the myriads. My heart is so selfish. My woes must are surely fleeting and unremarkable among the countless multitudes in Your creation. And You? So Eternal, Omnipotent, Omnipresent, Omniscient &#8230; all that I am not. My mind is incapable of grasping the wonder of You.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And yet. I <em>can</em> know absolutely that He cares &#8230; for me &#8230; and you. We <em>do</em> see the beauty of His handiwork and His revelation through our senses. But, even greater evidence is that same all-powerful, creative God wants to have a <em>relationship</em> with me! And you! If you wonder how I know this, I can be certain because He sent His Son, Jesus, to dwell among us on this planet. He came to teach, to heal, and to make a way for me, and all of us who seek God, to have relationship with his Almighty Majestic, Perfect Father. Jesus embodies the words of Eternal Life. Jesus, the only Son of God.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>&#8220;This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through Him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.&#8221; </em>&#8211; 1 John 4:9-11 (NIV)</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>&#8220;You have made them (human beings) a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor. &#8230; Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!&#8221; </em>Psalm 8:5,9 (NIV)</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Hallelujah!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-584\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/05/20/his-glory-and-majesty-and-me/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-584\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/05/20/his-glory-and-majesty-and-me/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-584\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/05/20/his-glory-and-majesty-and-me/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","excerpt":"<p>&#8220;Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
