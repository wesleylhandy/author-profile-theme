My father and I used to have such fun doing that. Later in life, I tried identifying optical illusions, searching for images that were not immediately recognizable. I confess, I don&#8217;t always discover the hidden objects as quickly as others. I have read that &#8220;seeing&#8221; what is hidden within the &#8220;visible&#8221; is a function of our perception, our ability to respond and <em>interpret</em> sensory information.</p>\n<p>In Scripture, we learn that God performed miraculous healing of physical eyes on a number of occasions so people could see. But, He also opened the eyes of humans to perceive things which were, at first, unseen in the natural. In one instance in 2 Kings, God encouraged the Israelites of the spiritual armaments He had prepared to protect them.</p>\n<p>In 2 Kings 6:16, the Lord encouraged the servant of Elisha in this way. The king of Syria was making war against Israel, and had sent a great army specifically to capture Elisha. &#8220;And Elisha prayed and said, &#8220;Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see,&#8221; (2 Kings 6:17 KJV). The servant had seen the physical presence of the enormous threat against them &#8230; with his own eyes. He was afraid of what seemed to be Elisha&#8217;s certain death. But God intervened and opened the servant&#8217;s eyes. He suddenly saw God&#8217;s army, horses, and chariots of fire all around Elisha, a compelling counterforce.</p>\n<p>God allowed the vision, the spiritual revelation, so they would regain courage in face of a seemingly insurmountable Enemy. At first, they had only seen with their physical eyes, and the threat was real. Yet, there was more provision behind the scenes. God had His invisible army, even more powerful than the Syrian forces prepared to defend His children.</p>\n<p>We live in a physical world, yet as humans with a mind, body, and spirit nature, why should we be surprised that there might be more to &#8220;see&#8221; in any given circumstance? Are we looking for God&#8217;s spiritual viewpoint when we face our trials and &#8220;insurmountables&#8221;? We often cannot see more than the present circumstances, and when those are painfully difficult, we lose heart.</p>\n<p>King David prayed to the Lord: &#8220;Open my eyes that I may see wondrous things from Your law,&#8221; (Psalm 119:18 KJV). Maybe we would be wise to pray the Lord open our eyes so we can see things in a dimension that God sees. What might we be missing by not praying that prayer? Maybe we need courage in times of attack. Perhaps, we don&#8217;t see the invisible forces He has already provided for us when we think we are alone.</p>\n<p>God made it clear that He wants a relationship with us. He loved us while we were yet far from Him, out doing our own thing, apart from His will. How do we know this?  He sent Jesus, His Son, to take the penalty of our sins so our most perfect, loving God could once again walk with us and talk with us as He had originally planned. After that, it was left to us to choose to align our lives by asking forgiveness, and accepting His free gift of relationship. We can be confident in our prayers that God is for us. He chose not to stay apart from us, and made a way for us to have relationship again after sin had, by its very nature, separated us from His Perfect Love.</p>\n<p>As the worship song lyrics by Michael W. Smith affirms, &#8220;Open the eyes of my heart, Lord, Open the eyes of my heart, I want to see You, I want to see You &#8230;&#8221; Let Him show you the spiritual dimension of life, tearing back the curtain of our physical and mental limitations. &#8220;I want to see You, Lord.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=open+the+eyes+of+my+heart+lord+michael+w+smithhttps://\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=open+the+eyes+of+my+heart+lord+michael+w+smithhttps://</a></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-710\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/11/30/open-the-eyes-of-my-heart-lord/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-710\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/11/30/open-the-eyes-of-my-heart-lord/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-710\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/11/30/open-the-eyes-of-my-heart-lord/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","excerpt":"<p>Did you ever &#8220;find&#8221; animals and shapes in the clouds when you were a child?
