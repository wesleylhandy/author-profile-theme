The old John Denver song (for those of you old enough to remember) comes to mind: &#8220;Sunshine on My Shoulders&#8221; of course &#8230; makes me happy! Somehow the sun has the power to transform a cold winter day from dreary to cheery. Sunshine delights the eyes as it illuminates and accentuates the early blooms of spring. Sunshine intensifies the glory of crimson and yellow fall leaves, leaving an onlooker breathless from its vibrant display. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in real life, not every day is so perfectly beautiful and filled with light. Your &#8220;skies&#8221; may turn dark. Storm clouds might roll in hard and fast. &nbsp;If you are from Tornado Alley, like I am, you may run to take cover as the green-gray cloud soup drapes itself over the land, and tiny funnel-shaped structures dip and dance overhead. There are certainly vivid Bible stories depicting the fears and consequences of storms at sea. Think of dear old Jonah who was trying to escape God&#8217;s directives. The Lord sent a great wind and a storm so wicked that the sailors were all afraid their ship would break up, leaving them to drown in the sea. God needed to get Jonah&#8217;s attention. And, he used that storm to speak to Jonah&#8217;s heart. When storm clouds threaten, do you call on the Lord? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Jesus and his disciples were crossing the Sea of Galilee, a sudden and furious squall arose. (Mark 4:35-42) Waves crashed over the boat, nearly swamping it. The disciples thought they might die, yet Jesus slept in the stern of the fishing vessel until they awakened him. He fussed a bit at their unbelief. &#8220;Do you still have no faith?&#8221; he asked. But, <em>before he spoke</em>&nbsp;to the disciples, he got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, &#8220;Quiet! Be still!&#8221; Wow. Just like that. The storm subsided. The disciples were in disbelief even though they had been following him for awhile! Yet, they feared death and destruction in that moment, when they couldn&#8217;t see the sunshine, but felt the wind. Yet, Jesus was right there. He was with them in that boat. Do we ever doubt where He is during the storms, or do we remember He is <em>with us</em>? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know we cannot always rebuke every storm in our lives and see it instantly dissolve. Yet, I want to take this analogy one step further. Oftentimes, our storms are not physical or environmental. Sometimes, they take place in our heads and hearts &#8230; a heaviness, a loneliness, a lack of joy, a grief that doesn&#8217;t seem to end. I want to encourage you to take heart. Though you may not see miracles every day, Jesus did tell the disciples in John 14:12, &#8220;,,, <em>whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you feel some torment from your spiritual antagonist, Satan himself, put on your spiritual armor and stand your ground. In James 4:7 we are reminded to submit ourselves, to God. Then,&nbsp;<em>&#8220;Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&#8221;&nbsp;</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a bad dream a week ago and it was a reminder of this principle. A dark and shadowy cloud formation was following me. I noticed it but kept walking. Then, I began running. It followed relentlessly. In this dream, I suddenly turned around to face that fearsome thing, and shouted, &#8220;STOP!&#8221; And, it did!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know. This was a dream. There was no real threat to me or my loved ones. &nbsp;Yet, I do believe the Lord speaks to us in dreams. The dark cloud stopped in its tracks, and I, in joyful amazement, praised God. It was only a dream, but symbolic, no doubt. &nbsp;I will wear my spiritual armor (Ephesians 6:10-18). When I feel the darkness of the Enemy discouraging me from fulfilling God&#8217;s purposes, I will boldly proclaim, &#8220;STOP! In the name of Jesus!&#8221;&nbsp;I pray this imagery will be an encouragement to you as well. I pray that you won&#8217;t be overcome by the one who wants you to lose hope in the storms of life. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-646\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/28/stop-in-the-name-of-jesus/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-646\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/28/stop-in-the-name-of-jesus/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-646\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/08/28/stop-in-the-name-of-jesus/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","excerpt":"<p>A reminder that we don&#8217;t have to remain helpless in the face of our spiritual enemies.
