He had convinced his mama to buy them for me when they were shopping. The uniqueness of this spray of flowers was that each large flower head was drooping, bowing down from its stem, rather than standing upright.</p>\n<p>Maxwell explained with confidence that they were simply being sunflowers which are always looking for the sun. Of course, I graciously accepted his gift with an exclamation of his thoughtfulness. His daddy brought some filler plants in from the yard, which somewhat improved their countenance.</p>\n<p>In reflecting on the downcast sunflowers, I was taken back by the image above of the girl gazing in the opposite direction. If the flowers symbolically seek the Sun, shouldn&#8217;t we also seek the Son, Jesus, for our Source? Yes, of course. There are times and seasons when we may be tempted to think we&#8217;re capable of handling life all on our own. All is well, finances are secure, health is good, and we have done it all ourselves. We may pat ourselves on the back and expect our fans to applaud because we&#8217;re successfully sailing along in our strength. Who needs God anyway, one might ask?</p>\n<p>But, often that isn&#8217;t the way life works. You know that. I know that. Sometimes, <em>nothing </em>seems to go our way. So in those times we can misguidedly plunder through our days, lacking the Son in the messiness of life, lacking His strength, peace, and His Omnipotent wisdom for guidance. Scripture is replete with advice for living a complete and satisfying life, in the good times and bad.</p>\n<p>In Hebrews 12:1-2 we are reminded to <em>&#8220;&#8230; fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter or our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&#8221; </em>Yes, indeed, as the sunflowers seek the sun, we are advised to &#8220;fix our eyes &#8230;.&#8221; Where? On the Son.</p>\n<p>Psalm 34:5-6 tells us that<em> &#8220;Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame. This poor man called, and the Lord heard him; he saved him out of all his troubles.&#8221; </em>More evidence that when we don&#8217;t look to ourselves, in our good old American independence, we will become radiant. We will be the sunflowers of humanity, with faces tilted upward with dignity, grace, and assurance. If you are feeling downcast today, pick up the Bible, and look to God&#8217;s Word to you. He will be your strength and radiance.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I need to seek the light of Christ &#8230;<em> daily.</em> Whenever I try to go it alone, I quickly become the wilty-headed sunflower, looking at the problems at my feet, instead of the Son&#8217;s LIGHT as my Source. I encourage all of us to not lose sight of God&#8217;s amazing gift, even in the hard times. When we &#8220;look up,&#8221; we will find the resources necessary to finish the race victoriously. Not because of our own tremendous capabilities, but because of our loving God and Provider. Look up to the Son, beloved children of God, and become all you are meant to be.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin,&#8221; 1 John 1:7. </em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-687\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/11/02/where-is-the-son/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-687\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/11/02/where-is-the-son/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-687\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/11/02/where-is-the-son/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","excerpt":"<p>&nbsp; While visiting our seven-year-old Kansas grandson recently, Max excitedly burst into the house carrying a bouquet of sunflowers &#8230; for me!
