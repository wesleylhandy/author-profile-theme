The puzzle had been a gift created from family photos, each image represented a favorite memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shrugging her little shoulders, Cassie replied, &#8220;I know he&#8217;s here! I just need to look harder.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Look, Cass, is this Daddy&#8217;s eye and nose?&#8221; I asked, holding up a piece. &#8220;Yes, yes, I see him!&#8221; my sweet grandchild answered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was reminded that sometimes I, too, have searched for my Father&#8217;s &#8220;face&#8221; among the disassembled puzzle pieces of my life. I&#8217;ve even cried out. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; In those times of darkness, I have to trust and remember who my Heavenly Father is. Like Cassie, I need to remember to &#8220;look harder&#8221; for evidence of God&#8217;s presence, instead of fixating on the unsolved problem. It seems to be human nature to painfully focus on what is wrong, those missing pieces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet we have assurance that God has not abandoned us. In Romans 8:38-39, He comforts His children. &#8220;For I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God&#8217;s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow&#8211;not even the powers of hell can separate us from God&#8217;s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below&#8211;indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.&#8221; ((NLT). &nbsp;What an all-encompassing promise!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exodus explains that God&#8217;s face is hidden from view because He is so holy.&nbsp;&#8220;But you may not look directly at my face, for no one may see me and live,&#8221; Exodus 33:20 (NLT). The Bible is explicit. God is not withholding his presence because he is an unkind Father, but He is so sinless<i>&nbsp;</i>that we could not survive a face-to-face encounter.\n\nThus, enters Christ. He is why we <em>can</em> have relationship with this Holy God. Through the sacrifice of Christ, the penalty for&nbsp;<em>our</em> sins have been laid to rest, absolved, on the cross. Father God can now see&nbsp;us as forgiven and perfect in His sight! The gift of Christ made a way for us to be brought back into an intimate relationship with<em> perfect</em> Father God!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been given the promise of seeing Father God face to face &#8230; someday &#8230; in heaven. &#8220;And they will see his face, and his name will be written on their foreheads. And there will be no night there&#8211;no need for lamps or sun&#8211;for the Lord God will shine on them,&#8221; Revelation 22:3-5a (NLT). I will then be perfected, and though in awe, I&#8217;m sure, I will see Him clearly, face to face. As the song title says, &#8220;I can only imagine &#8230;&#8221; what that will be like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when I feel like young Cassie, searching for the comfort of my Father&#8217;s face and presence, I can say with the confidence of a child, I know He is with me. Look for His presence around you. Listen for His voice, and watch for evidence in all ways.\n\nAs you search for your Spiritual Father &nbsp;in the middle of your unsolved puzzle, know He is near. You can encounter His presence. &#8220;Come close to God, and God will come close to you,&#8221; James 4:8 (NLT). His desire is to comfort you with great love and compassion. Look up from your despair, and He will show His face when you need it most.</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-627\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/07/19/my-daddys-face/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-627\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/07/19/my-daddys-face/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-627\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/07/19/my-daddys-face/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","uri":"/2019/07/19/my-daddys-face/","link":"https://bensonjj.blog/2019/07/19/my-daddys-face/","date":"2019-07-19T03:16:21","modified":"2019-07-19 14:56:09","author":{"name":"Joan C.
