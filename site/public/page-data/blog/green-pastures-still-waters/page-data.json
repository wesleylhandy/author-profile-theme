I looked up to find the little creature balancing on a power line. I smiled with gratitude. Flashbacks flooded my mind with the times God has comforted me with that same peaceful <em>coo-coo</em> &#8230; often when I needed it the most. I&#8217;m not superstitious about signs in nature, but I know how His magnificent creation often speaks to my heart. Many writers address how we can best get through the tough times. And, it&#8217;s true that we will experience trials. What about the times we feel the presence of God? What about the quiet, still moments when the &#8220;noise&#8221; of life doesn&#8217;t demand every inch of our attention? Do we take time to listen? Are we even aware of the Creator&#8217;s desire to have communion with us, His children?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trials May Come</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1 Peter 1:6 (NIV) we are told &#8220;though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.&#8221; 1 Thessalonians 3:3 goes even further by telling us we are <em>destined </em>for them (these trials). That&#8217;s certainly not the kind of good news I relish, but it seems to be a natural flow of life &#8230; for me, my family, and my friends. Yet, I take courage in knowing this earthly dwelling is temporal, and for this short time, our spiritual enemy has domain. We can rejoice knowing there will be no more sorrow, no more tears in our eternal home, Heaven. We will forever enjoy a beautiful intimacy with Father God, our Creator. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where Is God?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing this dichotomy, I have taken a deeper look at the 23rd Psalm. It reminds me again that God will be <em>with me </em>as I walk through the valleys on earth. He assures me He is present right in the middle of the mess of my life. It is my job to look for and listen for Him. In addition, Scripture says, God as my Shepherd &#8220;makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, (Psalm 23:2, NIV).&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Restoration</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, I love how God <em>makes me lie down</em>. I still remember as a little girl when my mom insisted I lie down, especially on a hot summer day. Didn&#8217;t she understand how busy I was? I had serious playing to do. Books to read. Friends to see. Skating. Biking. Yet my mom knew how I was made, and how much happier I would be if I rested. God knows when I need to have a &#8220;timeout&#8221; from my circumstances. What happens when He leads me to those still waters? Big stuff. He restores me. I become refreshed, and renewed from the chaffing of the rougher situations. I become stronger and more able to live victoriously even through the troubles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I take stock of my own testimony of faith, I stop to think about the times when God has intervened and set me in a quiet place. They may not have looked like still waters, but they were evident and restorative. A deep breath of peace. They are times when I sensed God&#8217;s presence. Sometimes, such experiences are as fleeting as the song of a dove, or a hug from a child. But regardless of the time, those memories linger as reminders of God&#8217;s care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>He is Speaking </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think for a minute about your own life. Everyone has ups and downs, mountaintops and valleys, joys and sorrows.  I would encourage you to look for those precious times when you have been able to stop to breathe, even in the midst of chaos. I pray that you have felt reminders of God&#8217;s love and comfort. Look for Him to show up when you need Him most. He may want you to lie down in green pastures. Listen for Him speaking to your heart.  </p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-832\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/28/green-pastures-still-waters/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-832\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/28/green-pastures-still-waters/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-832\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/28/green-pastures-still-waters/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2020-02-28T04:49:19.000Z","id":"2390a117-57b5-567b-981e-6123eb053477","link":"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/02/28/green-pastures-still-waters/","modified":"2020-04-11T13:53:34.000Z","title":"Green Pastures &#8211; Still Waters","tags":[{"name":"God"},{"name":"Listen"},{"name":"rest"}],"slug":"green-pastures-still-waters"}},"pageContext":{"postID":"2390a117-57b5-567b-981e-6123eb053477"}}}
