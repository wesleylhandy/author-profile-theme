At certain times in a young person&#8217;s life, the future seems wide open with opportunities. At other times, not so much. I know how excited I felt at being able to finally go after my childhood dreams and be &#8220;on my own.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each one of you have been blessed with a talent or maybe many, something unique to who you are. You may not know exactly what you want to do, but you are poised to leave childhood behind, and get into the adult sphere. Independence sounds so good, right?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Perhaps you&#8217;re an athlete. Or a musician. Maybe you worked hard to make good grades, and you were accepted into the university. Maybe you have in mind a certain kind of job, and you want to go out and earn a living for yourself. Maybe you have been accepted to the graduate school you want to attend. What about that sport you excel at, and want to play? What is that next step in your life?</p>\n<p>Right now, at this time in history, the world shut down right in the middle of your school semester. No goodbye parties. No last formal dances. No graduations. How does all of this impact you personally? Do you feel like you&#8217;ve experienced a profound loss? Or does it feel okay to simply move forward when the time is right?</p>\n<p>Though I didn&#8217;t have my milestone events swept away in high school, or college, I know many Americans have encountered major storms in the midst of their best hopes and dreams. We don&#8217;t have to go back in history very far to remember all the young men and women who either postponed their dreams to go fight for our freedom, or perhaps lost their dreams altogether. During the Great Depression, Americans lost many of their comforts, their &#8220;normal&#8221; way of life, and of course, in some instances, even the daily blessings of food and housing.</p>\n<p>We can go back to each dramatic period in history to see that we are not the first to face interruptions to our plans as we have during Covid-19. As you studied in history, the foundation of our nation was shaken to its core during the onset of the Civil War. States chose to withdraw from the Union, and families were sometimes split as to who they would fight for. It was not uncommon for cousins to be fighting cousins on the battlefield, or fathers and grandfathers fighting on the other side against their own flesh and blood. Everyone&#8217;s normal lives were changed and farmland became battleground. I can&#8217;t even imagine.</p>\n<p>The Bible tells us that human life is brief. When a person is standing on tiptoes leaning into their individual future, life seems to be very long. To see life in a larger frame, even an eternal perspective, Psalm 102:15 says, &#8220;Our days on earth are like grass; like wildflowers, we bloom and die. The wind blows, and we are gone&#8211;as though we had never been here.&#8221; (NLT) Yet, there is a much larger picture here, if you believe in God and His promise of eternal life through Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>Today may be brief compared to eternity, but that doesn&#8217;t eliminate God&#8217;s love or promises. In the same Psalm, we read, &#8220;But, the love of the Lord remains forever with those who fear (revere) him. His salvation extends to the children&#8217;s children of those who are faithful to his covenant, of those who obey his commandments!&#8221; (NLT)</p>\n<p>What do we do when we find our hopes dashed? How do we go on? Where does our hope come from? Loss is painful, no matter the size of it. What are your thoughts?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-913\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/06/08/hopes-dreams-expectations/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-913\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/06/08/hopes-dreams-expectations/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-pinterest-913\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text\" href=\"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/06/08/hopes-dreams-expectations/?share=pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span></span><span class=\"sharing-screen-reader-text\">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>","date":"2020-06-08T16:48:41.000Z","id":"9a7aadf9-ea60-585d-be55-8fa162e4c35d","link":"https://bensonjj.blog/2020/06/08/hopes-dreams-expectations/","modified":"2020-06-10T18:45:31.000Z","title":"Hopes, Dreams, Expectations","tags":null,"slug":"hopes-dreams-expectations"}},"pageContext":{"postID":"9a7aadf9-ea60-585d-be55-8fa162e4c35d"}}}
